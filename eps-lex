Not really going to repeat all the words since they kind-of-exist in ers-lex
right now. Might do that later.

But I will repeat the more grammatical(ized) affixes so I have a list of them.

-uʔʲ PROX, fossilized in Maotic. This may be the same particle as PT -ō which is
 basically just a nominalizer.

-ʔn uncertain. In Maotic it's attached to most (?) verbs but not productively.

-ti uncertain. (Actually I'm not sure how P* this even is. All I know is it's PT
 -ši.) Maotic suffix attached to some numerals

-wi uncertain. Maotic suffix attached to other numerals. Similarly this may not
 be P* but instead just PT.

-wr forms ordinals

-(n)G adj.

-w- ?? (appears in évos "ladder")

-ar probably like -tron

-kl adj.

-rʔ ?? (appears in horis)

-ik ?? (appears in îk "hillside")

-ak ?? (appears in kancok "line" and vaorok "number")

-ta ?? appears in lîrta "end" and rinta "a death". Apparently a less common
 nominalizer in Taol.

-kʲiʔ augm.

-iʔʲ pl.

-tʲrʲ agent

-l locative?
