\section*{Preface}

The following is the original text of a Maotic treatise published by Chásur, namely, Ûchiker's \emph{Taol 16}. The treatise is simply a collection of rituals of various forms, without analysis and with only minimal explanatory commentary.

Out of universe, the rituals are not of my own invention, but are instead direct translations of the text of the twelve songs of Disparition's album \emph{Granicha} (excluding, of course, the entirely instrumental ``Poem for a Crack in the Wall'' and ``Poem for the Unspoken''). These songs are, as stated by Disparition, rituals, largely concerned with water and especially rivers, and this seemed fitting for the Taol, a people whose name literally derives from a word whose in-universe meaning is ``river'', whose land is inundated with rivers, and for whom rivers are a central aspect of life. The songs of \emph{Granicha} are also, as the title might suggest, concerned with borders (Slavic \textit{*granica} ``border''), although this is distinctly less important to the Taol. The actual text of the songs of \emph{Granicha}, and the clarity or obscurity with which these themes are portrayed, varies wildly, but I feel that they are not out of place as ritual texts for a constructed culture.

Perhaps more importantly, though, I am quite fond of the album musically, and I appreciate it lyrically as well. I find its lyrics a reasonable source of translation, and hence they are now Maotic rituals.

Some of the translated text warrants some special notice, where I have replaced English names with Maotic analogues. In the songs ``A Fire in the Distant Hills'' (the sixth ritual listed) and ``Song for the Other Side'' (the eighth) the names of real rivers are given: Danube, Rio Grande, Dniester, Severn. I have replaced these respectively with Elmin rivers: Molcrá, Úrol, Septé, Dzao.

The other notable difficulty in translation is with the third song, ``Doggerland''. As the name suggests, the song concerns the now sunken land which once connected the British Isles to the mainland of Europe. Its text includes the line ``You were there, where R\={e}nos met Tameses'' — that is, where the Rhine met the Thames, a place which only existed in Doggerland. Needless to say, there is no similar place in Elmincár, and I do not wish to introduce one simply to satisfy a translation. Reference to the fall of Dalia could be made, but this took place only a few centuries before the present, and would not match the tone of Doggerland, which was submerged in prehistoric times.

What \emph{is} prehistoric in Elmincár, however, is the creation of the world, or more crucially the modern form thereof. Legend states that the Édris Elmin did not always exist, but were raised by the gods myriad years ago. The legends are vague as to whether this happened during the creation of the world or long after it, but some do believe the latter, and that once the river Maoth flowed west — backwards! — to meet the Peréx.

Ód harmó\oocfootnote{Lit. ``beginning''. The usual word for ``source (of a river)'' is \emph{khalun} ``head'', but the next line also uses \emph{khalun}, and in order to avoid repetition where not warranted I've translated this using a different word.} mon rín \\

However, with \emph{umín} used above—even without \emph{in}—I chose a different formulation to avoid repetition.} \\

\section{\oocfootnote{From ``Fault''.}}

[An Amain ritual reported to me indirectly from a source in Ínalca on the Maotel. The text is rather obscure and, given the unverifiability of the source, may be incorrect.]

% FIXME ZF: Amain has some dialectal features. What are they? Adjust this accordingly. Though honestly it's probably not much, Amain isn't that out there. Also spelling isn't going to change at all.
