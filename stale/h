A sample sentence recovered from the incubator. The joke here was to add a
million "laryngeals". That joke is probably bad but otherwise I don't hate the
aesthetic here, so it's plausibly usable:

H̭tanahħī qusmaxxaiḫ aṣ ḥaṇāthiyaȟ paṭṭikah aṣ fauḫa, kīẖ ẖpawāh̭xas tayȟā laiṣḩ
ḩrawiyāuk, ḩi taiḫ aḷaḥāim-h̭i.

The given phonology, besides the h-sounds, is:

p t k q /k_w/ ṭ /t`/ f s ṣ m n ṇ l ḷ

a ā i ī u ū ai āi au āu
