since then. I could potentially adapt these into P* affixes however.]

[From the incubator]

Caighir is a distant descendant of the Maotic language. It is the standard
dialect; another dialect is called Thâgwhanaigh. In Caighir these are pronounced
[ˈkʲæɣɨʁ] and [ˌθag.wəˈnəɪ]. In Thagwhanaigh they are pronounced /tʃeɪɹ/ and
/tʃɜ̀ːwaːniː/. The etymology of the latter is (point of divergence) *tʰaːgwanakʲe
< (Maotic) *Thao-kuelin-óké. The -óké suffix is the same one as in Soróké, a
dialect of Maotic.
