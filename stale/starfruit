*fruit Traits


as a reminder *fruit is found in western Agrócár.


*fruit is going to be shit ~polynesian~ in phonology. Most of the languages there are boring "ba maa, ba maa gaa" languages BUT we will have also a few that have some interesting features.

it will also have tones. anything that was interesting about proto-tonal should get subsumed here somehow, although some of those might be hard

anyway. having a h13-style isolating grammar is boring and I don't want to do that. I mean, we are going to be isolating, but we are going to do it in a very different style; we're going to have a bunch of classifiers and conjunctions and stuff and probably a very rigid word order.

how about this

the genitive construction "a map of the world"

would normally be expressed as

*sat alman no lū fat

where *sat is the article used for when there is only one of something
      *lū is the general indefinite article (distinct from e.g. fīʔ "a certain" among others)

but actually in this case we do

*lu fat kiʔ no sat alman

where *kiʔ is the general pronoun meaning 'it'
      *lu changed length for some sandhi-related reason

and notably, this isn't due to a different meaning of *no or topic-fronting... it's something else, and I'm not sure what.
