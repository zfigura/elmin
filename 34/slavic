nashtorovny (Russian nésterovna? which itself has uncertain etymology)


* Initial A in Aleksej is long, raises to ē and breaks to ye. That A is
  supposedly already long in PS, and it's not stressed.

* First e in Nesterov lowers to A (apparently after palatalizing the
  neighbouring s? Or is that some weird cluster effect? I prefer the latter)

  - Actually, it's probably not Nesterov, but rather Dъněstrov. The yat
    eventually lowers to a. Note that this conflicts with long ā breaking, but I
    think this vowel is shortened and therefore has a different reflex.

* Second e becomes o, however. I think this is assimilation to the following o.

* Why does the e in Aleksij raise to i, but the e in Nesterov lower to a?

PS long vowels are ī ū ǣ ā ɨː <i u ě a y>, short i u e o ẽ õ <ь ъ e o ę ǫ>.
PIE ē > ě, a > o, ō/ū > y, au/eu > u??

* Uniquely for a Slavlang, the long/short system makes some effort towards
  regaining symmetry. One of the major changes we have is that I think vowels
  shorten in closed syllables and lengthen in open ones, while retaining
  quality. Also, æ merges with a.

  This would give us symmetrical i e a o u y... but we may need to leave a bit
  more complexity in there.

  After this point ā raises to ē, e > i, but a remains a (unless yat is distinct
  from original ā somehow). Does ē > ī? However lengthened ь lowers to ē.

  I think ь ъ remain separate vowel qualities, probably more centralized.
  Possibly ь merges with ɨ.


* one palatal series. PS has two:

  - č ž š (1st regressive palatalization of k g x) [tʃ ʒ ʃ]. [nb x is from s via
    ruki]

  - c ʒ ś (2nd regressive palatalization of k g x) [ts dz ɕ?]. This basically
    only affects secondary yat from original *ai.

  - There is also a third "progressive" palatalization from preceding i, again
    k g x > ts dz ś.

  We'll take both (unlike Novgaradian), but unlike every(?) other Slavic
  language they'll both become palatal tʃ dʒ ʃ.

  Except: ž (from first palatalization) deaffricates early, but dz doesn't, so
  the only diachronic source of dʒ in our language is from *gě. Needless to say
  there are very few of these: *dzěl- "vehement" > "very" and *gvězda "star" are
  the only two I could find (at least that begin with *g).

  ś š both > ʃ (like West Slavic I guess).

  What happens to *s z ʒ x?

  - ʒ z could very well devoice to ʃ s.

  - x > k?

  - x > f before roundeds? And it dies in clusters. This would leave only <xa>.

  - Could we palatalize xa > śa? Basically an extended version of the 2RP. The
    only particular problem with this is that Olyegy lacks palatalization.
    However this could easily be analogy/regularization (feminine nouns would
    have mixed palatalization and about half of the forms are still before back
    vowels). (We could also limit xa > śa and keep ka/ga, but I like this
    solution better. It helps the fact that dʒ is weirdly rare.)

  - I think s/ʃ contrast dies in clusters, and outside of clusters s > x (> f)
    is not unlikely.

* Cluster simplification. I don't know exactly what this encompasses, but at the
  very least, all clusters devoice (or lose a voicing contrast).

  CrV gains a breaking vowel which I think is always the following vowel.
