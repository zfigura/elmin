MAOTIC, or as I like to call it River Speech

* Taol is isolating as has been established.

* In the map we have several noun phrases that semantically look somewhere
  between English noun phrases and proper genitive constructions. Most of these
  are head-initial: Namó Ablés, Édris Elmin (?), Agróme Toléith and Etkai
  Toléith, Ash Alóné, Harad Cuerol, Actó Atlas, also "adjectival" Ash Cásper,
  but "Fír Édris" and *cár are head-final, and also "ó tárá cár". There are also
  phrases "phato in Elmincár" and "Dalia in hesó" where "in" is definitely a
  genitive preposition.

  So I think Taol is just head-initial in general, and in fact VSO too. The
  reversal in the few phrases we have there is I think an archaïsm (as is
  writing it as a single word). Not doing the focus nonsense this time.

* Taol is very isolating *but* doesn't use serial verbs I think. So instead it's
  going to use a lot of conjunctions and prepositions.

* /r/ is onset-only, /R/ is rime-only. Not sure what happens to onset *G, maybe
  it just dies.

* Plural -í is archaic.

* I think that the distinction between ê/î, ô/û was not phonemic, but Classical
  Maotic uses both interchangeably



Maotic needs reworked. I just don't like the way it looks in the Granicha
translation. I think it would benefit both from being less SAE—the phonology may
not be fixable but the syllable structure could be—and from being shorter.
[Words are kinda long for being isolating. I don't think Maotic is very heavy on
the derivational morphology either, in fact I think almost everything in it is
fossilized. [So it's English but EVEN MORE]]

One thing I notice if I step back and look at the map again is that most of the
words that are definitely Maotic and *not* loanwords are surprisingly CRV. There
are finals but they're rare. The full list of definitely common nouns is:

* namó "sea"
* ablés "storm"
* agróme "forest", also agró-
* tolet "tree"
* cár "land"
* fír "green", also fíre-
* édris "mountain"
* elmin "world"
* actó "rift, division"
* atlas "large"
* etkai "island"
* ash "ocean". This is obviously a loan. Qoqq?
* alóné "east"
* casper "warm"
* taló "river" - not sure if T. stands for this but probably?
* été "desert"??
* harad "plains"
* cuerol "south"
* phato "map" [accent?]
* á "or"
* ó "to"
* in "of"
* hesó?

PNs are... honestly I don't even know if it's worth bringing *any* of the PNs
into this. Even the ones in the *heart* of the Maotic land could easily be
exonyms. I will point out Cabor/Cabotel, Maoth/Maotel. Aspen is in the heart but
damn if it doesn't look more like a Kyndae word than any of the others on this
list. Dzao is almost certainly a Maotic dialect that affricates something, or
possibly Eastern Taol. Akol Bílé looks plausible.

Dálx has an insane European final cluster which is definitely not typical of
anything Tavarian or Taol, or Yangharad. It's areally unique and although it's
kind of cheesy I'm seriously tempted to say it's from a Dalian sacred tongue.

  WAIT OF COURSE IT IS—it's a nonsense word invented by Dalus himself, in what
  would of course be a typical nonsense-word phonology for his *own* native
  language. Well, it's a semi-nonsense word where the first half is of course
  the same syllable as Dalia. (Which is also something he named, probably after
  himself, though there is at least one real Δηλια in existence.)

Notes on this:

* The only word with k is etkai. etkai is also the only word with a diphthong
  (not counting ue/ao). Last time it was easy to look at the unusual -tk-
  cluster and the -i and call it a loan. This time I'm less sure. If it is a
  loan it looks Tavarian?

  I don't want to kill it just because of k though. The c/k bit + having exactly
  one palatalized consonant in the language is one of the more interesting bits
  about Maotic. The -i diphthong I'm less savvy about. I was going to be less
  savvy about the stop cluster but actó is also a stop cluster so maybe it's
  fine.

  - Fun fact: the diphthong ao actually doesn't appear, and ue only once! But I
    still like them so they're staying.

* Most words are CVR (some CVCVR), where r is <ʁ s n l m>. Exceptions:

  - Several words in VCCVR where V₁ is /a/ or /e/ (once long). I like the idea
    of saying this is a P* thing. Most have a CR cluster except actó, etkai.

    I don't know what the explanation for the P* thing is and I rather like the
    idea of it being up in the air. It calls to mind sesquisyllables, but no
    language with sesquisyllables has them in such a restricted form as to never
    have an onset. And the limited vowel distribution is itself suspicious.

    I do think this suggests a sonority thing for Taol, which lends more weight
    to this "s patterns as a semivowel" thing.

  - Two words ending in actual stops: tolet [note the variant toléith does not
    appear on the map], harad. Maybe these are loans and maybe they aren't; I
    don't know. P* had basically no phonotactical rules but I'd kinda rather not
    make exception for these. Not gonna lie those two words look decently
    Tavarian anyway. (Does Tavarian actually have a five-vowel system?)

  - One word 'casper' which I guess could just be CVRCVR? It violates the Taol
    sonority hierarchy established above. Does Maotic still have the same
    hierarchy?

* Few fricatives /f s h/. I think these should be rare


I'm going to continue to use this as a staging area for the P*/Maotic redesign.

I think:

* I still want P* to have a phonotactics of "whatever". This kind of implies it
  doesn't have particularly specific syllable structures.

  At the same time, the sesquisyllables kind of have to date back to P*
  (otherwise I'm forced to invent an explanation for them and I don't want
  that), and their very existence kind of forces P* to have an idea of a
  specific syllable structure.

  I think the conclusion has to be that P* has a specific root syllable
  structure *but* affixes are arbitrary and it's not afraid to just glom them on
  with no regard for phonotactics. I think the even further idea is that P*
  basically is in a very specific stage where its idea of syllable structure has
  completely fallen apart and is about to get independently reinvented by each
  daughter.

  In the case of Taol you get this awkward situation of "well the initial needs
  to follow this sonority hierarchy, and probably the final does too in reverse.
  But initial clusters only happen with the presyllable, and final clusters
  don't happen because we dropped all final obstruents", probably with some
  loanword exceptions that prove the rule. The more correct idea is that the
  sonority hierarchy determines what counts as an onset and what counts as a
  coda, and then with this in mind codas are just lost, except for word-final
  sonorants. Weird! (Hell, is coda loss even a general Taol thing? Maybe just
  Maotic does that.)

* I think P* has final clusters in general, at least CC if not more. (CVCCC
  without initial clusters is... is that realistic?) Taol/Maotic loses them.

  One interesting effect of this is that if P* generally tries to express
  morphology through agglutination, and that's mostly suffixing, Maotic halts
  this in its tracks and forces new analytic constructs to develop to replace
  those inflections

* Does P* have *initial* clusters? This is a trickier question. The list of 23
  morphemes above suggests no, except for the Cʔ in <phato>.

  The feminine words are (slightly?) more often VCCV than VCV, but none of the
  masculine words begin with a cluster. I like this distribution and while I
  think there should be *some* words beginning with CC, I don't want too many of
  them.

  One explanation is that words with CC- died at some point, but I feel like
  this clashes with other phonotactical changes.

  A different explanation is that P* already had this restriction, and I guess
  pre-P* syllables are just CVCC or something like that. (Obviously P* with its
  grammaticalization broke that constraint all the time.) The problem here is
  the glottalization rules—we usually treat the glottal stop as a separate
  consonant—but I actually kind of like this problem and want to keep it. Like,
  yeah, *usually* this was P* phonotactics, but what's up with the glottal stop?
  Should it not be reconstructed as a separate segment?

  - So... why is the glottal stop a separate segment? An evil idea hit me:

    We know that Taol resolves it into three different phonations. My notes are
    this is probably a whole Southern branch thing (but maybe revisit this). At
    any rate the Southern branch reconstructions probably don't point to
    anything but phonation.

    (What is probably true is that glued words or affixes do affect phonation
    predictably. But this is weak evidence if any for anything weird about the
    glottal stop.)

    Catathaolian has a different resolution than Taol/Southern but it still
    doesn't mean anything other than a phonation difference.

    Some branch, not sure which, resolves ʔC and I think also Cʔ to ʔ and then
    keeps ʔ. This might be either *fish, *fruit [in which case Southern
    consonant resolution is not actually Southern], or maybe Tentative
    Fírecárian * Language (Tyräli?). I may like the *fruit way best [should it
    be shared with MT then?]

    - I don't think it can be *fruit, because *fruit needs a proper nasal series
      and I think that needs to come from the voiced stops. I guess we *could*
      do a shift?? But I also like Tʰ > fricative...

    What we have not done, and what I think belongs in *fish, is breaking up of
    consonant clusters—including glottal clusters—with a vowel. The beautiful
    thing about doing this in *fish is that it allows us to actually not specify
    modern pronunciation—and the even more beautiful thing is we don't have to
    write a glottal stop. Does <itiik> "two" have a long vowel? Maybe, but then
    what about <vitii> "nape"; why would that vowel be long if it corresponds
    with Taol <fithi>? Why does <itiik> have an initial vowel and why does
    <kutu> "blue" have a final vowel?

* Would it be altogether insane to allow /t/ as a final stop?

  Or hmm, what if tʰ > θ conditionally at word end, and because it's a fricative
  it patterns as a semivowel like /s/? Kind of insane but could work. That would
  explain toléith and melith...

  Taol always simplifies clusters, but I think it leaves single final stops. So
  some of the loss is early Maotic too but if it leaves θ that could...
  honestly... work? The unfortuante thing about this is that it is typologically
  weird.
