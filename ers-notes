MAOTIC, or as I like to call it River Speech

* Taol is isolating as has been established.

* In the map we have several noun phrases that semantically look somewhere
  between English noun phrases and proper genitive constructions. Most of these
  are head-initial: Namó Ablés, Édris Elmin (?), Agróme Toléith and Etkai
  Toléith, Ash Alóné, Harad Cuerol, Actó Atlas, also "adjectival" Ash Cásper,
  but "Fír Édris" and *cár are head-final, and also "ó tárá cár". There are also
  phrases "phato in Elmincár" and "Dalia in hesó" where "in" is definitely a
  genitive preposition.

  So I think Taol is just head-initial in general, and in fact VSO too. The
  reversal in the few phrases we have there is I think an archaïsm (as is
  writing it as a single word). Not doing the focus nonsense this time.

* Taol is very isolating *but* doesn't use serial verbs I think. So instead it's
  going to use a lot of conjunctions and prepositions.

* /r/ is onset-only, /R/ is rime-only. Not sure what happens to onset *G, maybe
  it just dies.

* Plural -í is archaic.

* I think that the distinction between ê/î, ô/û was not phonemic, but Classical
  Maotic uses both interchangeably
