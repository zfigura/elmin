* Disappearance of glottal stop and associated changes (ʔT -> D, Vʔ > V:, Tʔ >
  Tʰ) is a change shared across at least Taol, Mittelo-Tavarian, *fruit. It is
  not part of Geönian or *fish. It *might* be part of Kyndae

* Palatalization is retained in *some* consonants/environments in Kyndae.
  Actually Taol retains it in /k/ vs /kʲ/ as we recall, but I think Kyndae
  probably affricates a bunch of alveolars and maybe also palatals. Kyndae also
  has retroflexes and I don't know offhand where it gets them. Mittelo-Tavarian
  doesn't retain palatalization but does have /kʲ k/ > /k q/. *fruit loses
  uvulars again. Geonian and *fish probably lose palatalization?

* Copying it here: Classical Maotic /kʲʰa:suʁ/, Modern /ɕʰasɐ/, Dálx /hɛ̈:sɔ/. A
  few things here worth noting:

  - Dálx retains the length contrast from classical Maotic; modern Maotic does
    not. Dálx actually has a three-way contrast in vowels though: aspirates lose
    their aspiration and grant breathy-voice to neighbouring vowels. I think
    this contrast is three way and not four way but I don't know how exactly.
    Possibly the contrast is only able to survive in long vowels.

  - ʁ does not exist at all in any modern Maotic dialect. (I do not remember in
    what positions r/ʁ are distributed. It is a trill in "édris" at least.) It
    seems to lower vowels in both Maotic and Dálx though (but a couple of more
    eastern dialects don't have this—I think Insular Sóróké might be an
    example?) to different degrees.

  - /kʲ/ is a fully coronal affricate or worse in all dialects. In Dálx it has
    also debuccalized.

* <ash> "ocean" is a Maotic loanword. This actually is pronounced /aʃ/ in
  Maotic; /ʃ/ is a loan-phoneme and Maotic has /ɕ/ anyway so it's justified.
  (Who has /ʃ/ in general? Anything in the Kyndae family has it; at least some
  Geönian and Tavarian languages have it. Mittelic languages definitely have it.
  Also Sóróké fricates /s/ in some positions. Insular Sóróké might well fricate
  it everywhere.

* Maotic does not have /mb nd ŋg/ natively at all. But it was loaned. However—I
  don't know if /mb nd ŋg/ was ever pronounced as such but it was regularly
  flattened into /m n ŋ/. This is where Maotic gets phonemic /ŋ/ from. It's
  quite likely that High Tavarian did not initially have standalone /ŋ/ (it is a
  * language, after all!) and instead loaned Yangharad /yaŋ̇/ as /yarŋg/, and
  only later this became /hrŋ/ in Tavarian dialects. In fact some dialects have
  /hrŋɣ/ instead! (Tavarian is weird that way.) We could take this further and
  have /hr̃ɣ/.

* Proto-* is a synthetic (but not polysynthetic) language with very short
  affixes (less than a syllable). Tavarian retains this and is varying degrees
  of fusional. Kyndae is fully fusional. Taol drops this; it is entirely
  isolating in terms of morphology and is mostly isolating in derivation as well
  (all endings are nonproductive). Some compounds are traditionally written as
  one word (Elmincár) but there's not really any reason they need to be.

* Ksqyidy /ks=qʲidʲ/ is new my favourite one-off. It's a Low Tavarian dialect,
  spoken I don't know where. (Probably lowland, west of Namó Ablés but south of
  Toi-Kántr.) It has vocalic /s z/, but these also should show up in diphthongs
  (we already have Yzaŋ "Yangharad").

* not proto-*, but, I had some shower thoughts about alien biology, specifically
  fairy biology. Consider a species that can produce buzzing or fricative sounds
  but not clicks or stops. Sort of birdlike (although birds can click). Also the
  usual thing with this kind of species is to make them Tonal, but here I want
  to subvert that and say that they can't do tone either. Not sure if their
  speech is entirely monotone or if tone just is never phonemic.

* thoughts about M-T:

  - we have *Tāl as a middle form, yielding Taol. In Tavarian this becomes
    *Tāw-aw > Tawå, borrowed back into Maotic as Tavar. Later Taol scholars see
    Tavar and correctly find it cognate, but assume that r = l and ava = awa =
    ao.

  - Derive more of the vowel system from the above. The "south" branch of * that
    includes Taol, M-T, *fruit gains a nice vowel length distinction from P-*'s
    glottals. Taol kind of retains that although it's unstable and some of the
    vowels break. M-T doesn't, though. Proto-M-T has a length distinction—we
    know this because it affects descendants and because it matches Taol and
    *fruit nicely—but that length distinction doesn't show up at all in any of
    its descendants. What *does* happen is that Taol dialects end up deleting or
    reducing a lot of the short vowels. Note from the above example that HT
    smooths aw > å (which is idk some sort of "backed" ā) and LT simply deletes
    the /a/.

  - I have notes about Ksqyidy and Low Tavarian in general in my notebook. Need
    to copy some of those here.
