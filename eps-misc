* Disappearance of glottal stop and associated changes (ʔT -> D, Vʔ > V:, Tʔ >
  Tʰ) is a change shared across at least Taol, Mittelo-Tavarian, *fruit. It is
  not part of Geönian or *fish. It *might* be part of Kyndae

* Palatalization is retained in *some* consonants/environments in Kyndae.
  Actually Taol retains it in /k/ vs /kʲ/ as we recall, but I think Kyndae
  probably affricates a bunch of alveolars and maybe also palatals. Kyndae also
  has retroflexes and I don't know offhand where it gets them. Mittelo-Tavarian
  doesn't retain palatalization but does have /kʲ k/ > /k q/. *fruit loses
  uvulars again. Geonian and *fish probably lose palatalization?

* Copying it here: Classical Maotic /kʲʰa:suʁ/, Modern /ɕʰasɐ/, Dálx /hɛ̈:sɔ/. A
  few things here worth noting:

  - Dálx retains the length contrast from classical Maotic; modern Maotic does
    not. Dálx actually has a three-way contrast in vowels though: aspirates lose
    their aspiration and grant breathy-voice to neighbouring vowels. I think
    this contrast is three way and not four way but I don't know how exactly.

  - ʁ does not exist at all in any modern Maotic dialect. (I do not remember in
    what positions r/ʁ are distributed. It is a trill in "édris" at least.) It
    seems to lower vowels in both Maotic and Dálx though (but a couple of more
    eastern dialects don't have this—I think Insular Sóróké might be an
    example?) to different degrees.

  - /kʲ/ has fully palatalized.

* <ash> "ocean" is a Maotic loanword. This actually is pronounced /aʃ/ in
  Maotic; /ʃ/ is a loan-phoneme and Maotic has /ɕ/ anyway so it's justified.
  (Who has /ʃ/ in general? Anything in the Kyndae family has it; at least some
  Geönian and Tavarian languages have it. Mittelic languages definitely have it.
  Also Sóróké fricates /s/ in some positions. Insular Sóróké might well fricate
  it everywhere.

* Maotic does not have /mb nd ŋg/ natively at all. But it was loaned. However—I
  don't know if /mb nd ŋg/ was ever pronounced as such but it was regularly
  flattened into /m n ŋ/. This is where Maotic gets phonemic /ŋ/ from. It's
  quite likely that High Tavarian did not initially have standalone /ŋ/ (it is a
  * language, after all!) and instead loaned Yangharad /yaŋ̇/ as /yarŋg/, and
  only later this became /hrŋ/ in Tavarian dialects. In fact some dialects have
  /hrŋɣ/ instead! (Tavarian is weird that way.) We could take this further and
  have /hr̃ɣ/.
