* Disappearance of glottal stop and associated changes (ʔT -> D, Vʔ > V:, Tʔ >
  Tʰ) is a change shared across at least Taol, Mittelo-Tavarian, *fruit. It is
  not part of Geönian or *fish. It *might* be part of Kyndae

* Palatalization is retained in *some* consonants/environments in Kyndae.
  Actually Taol retains it in /k/ vs /kʲ/ as we recall, but I think Kyndae
  probably affricates a bunch of alveolars and maybe also palatals. Kyndae also
  has retroflexes and I don't know offhand where it gets them. Mittelo-Tavarian
  doesn't retain palatalization but does have /kʲ k/ > /k q/. *fruit loses
  uvulars again. Geonian and *fish probably lose palatalization?
