Alex inspired me for some reason

--

In my blood I carry you, in my blood we are whole. In this death and the next,
undying, I love you

	Ot amat vaí aíl vaí pár, ot amat vaí cilín vaí lu haonot. Ot rinta ciú
	met ot rinta ciál, vaí vel rinta rolthin pár

		- "vaí lu" is lit. "1sg all". "all" serves to pluralize the 1sg
                  (as often) but also has a bit of extra collective force
                  (fitting with "whole").

		- use of "ot" in the second sentence is weird in Maotic, but
                  it's also mildly weird in English, and I think that it's right
                  because it's what's used in the previous clause
