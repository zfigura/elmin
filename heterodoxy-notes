Heterodoxy 120: Introduction to Conlanging Theory (no lab component)

ESSAY STRUCTURE (order is not fixed)

- Analogy

  - Analogy can be partial!!

- Equilibria. The idea is not "stay in the center" but "think about how far out
  you are, and maybe don't go too far". It is very much an intuitive sense.

  - equilibrium of complexity

  - equilibrium of redundancy

  - equilibrium of length

- Forbidden structures. (Perhaps more generally: language is an approximation of
  thought, and the accuracy of that approximation varies. Maybe that too is an
  equilibrium, although it's not really the same type)

- Anti-cartesianism. Both in the sense of:

  - think about making individual slots not contain a cartesian product of two
    categories. This can be achieved by:

    - syncretism

    - combine the two categories and think about connotative meaning. "X
      implies/is similar to Y" means that "X" and "Y" can be the same morpheme,
      even if they're in different categories. the primary meaning can be one or
      the other, and it can vary across morphemes in different categories.

      TAM is the obvious example here, but it doesn't need to be the only one!
      Vocabulary is another good place to apply this. I originally wrote
      "morpheme slots" here, but you can apply it also to things like phonology.

  - Also consider applying analogy to cartesian systems within a single slot,
    that sort of thing is complex and likes to simplify to separate slots.
    Analogy can be partial!

  - think about making two different (but related/close) slots not quite be
    cartesianly combinable. Obviously don't do this for everything (some aspects
    of language really are cartesian), but it's a tool you can and should use.
    This can be achieved by:

    - forbidden structures

    - allowing them to combine but changing the way they combine. (Fusion,
      reversal, add a new morpheme, I dunno what else). The canonical example of
      this design principle is synchronic sound change
