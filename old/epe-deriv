Ideas for sound changes from Proto-Elmin (Toléith):
(Note: > means chain shift, → is intermediate steps.)

ná'oolkiłí: Tones > voicing
Cy Cȳ Cŷ → Cy̤ Cy Cy̰ → Cʰ C Cʼ
(note: this seems to run contrary to reverse Chinese.)

Tones > stress (remove ŷ first?)

Tones > length
y ȳ ŷ as Germanic (y yː yːː)
