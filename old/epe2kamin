List of sound changes from Proto-Elmin to Kámin (shush)

1 A few tone sandhi rules: HMM > HLM, HH > HM, LL > LM, MMH > LMH
2 Geminated nasals shorten. Non-geminated intervocalic nasals elide except when following /ə/. Initial/final nasal elides only when the first/last syllable is low and the nasal does not border ɰ.
2 Clusters of two or more vowels lengthen the first. Overlong vowels reduced to Vː
3 /w/ delabialized to /ɰ/
4 /ɰ/ > /h/, which then devocalises any adjacent cluster, or nasalizes the following vowel.
5 /mn/,/nm/ → /m͡n/ → /nʷ/ > /n/ > /ɲ/ (including unvoiced) [Note: /n/ does not change next to front vowels.]
6 Approximants bordering nasals change the POA of the nasal to the POA of the approximant, then disappear.
7 Approximant clusters assimilate to the first approximant.
8 Intervocalic single approximants β̞,j,ɹ > β̝,ʝ,z (including geminated)
9 Non-geminated intervocalic nasals become stops; geminated intervocalic nasals become /nd/ &c.
10 Initial and final voiced consonants devoice.
10 Low-tone vowels (not ə) are deleted. If long, they are shortened.
11 Non-geminated consonants following high-tone vowels are geminated.
12 All tone distinction is lost.
