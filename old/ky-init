There were really five vowels /a e i o u/, with weak allophones /ɑ ɛ ɪ ɔ ʊ/, or perhaps it is better to say that the former were allophones of the latter. There was also a schwa, written as ⟨y⟩. Kyndæ had a stress system; the stressed syllable had to be marked. However, the stressed syllable could be either a weak vowel (marked with an acute accent) or a strong vowel (marked with a circumflex.) Vowels at the end of a word were pronounced as strong vowels. The schwa had no strong form and could not appear in one. Observe:

[b]kâhu[/b] /ˈkahu/
[b]káhu[/b] /ˈkɑhu/
[b]káhuk[/b] /ˈkɑhʊk/
[b]kahúk[/b] /kɑˈhʊk/
[b]kahûk[/b] /kɑˈhuk/
[b]kýhu[/b] /ˈkəhu/
[b]kyhú[/b] /kəˈhu/

There were three diphthongs: /aj oj aw/, which were written as ⟨ai oi au⟩. The stressed forms were written as ⟨aî oî aû⟩, of course, and there was no weak/strong distinction. All groups of two vowels that were [i]not[/i] a diphthong were marked with a diaeresis (typically on the first vowel), regardless of whether they could be confused for one or not. The first vowel was always pronounced in the strong form. Observe:
[b]kâhüa[/b] /ˈkahu.a/
[b]kâhüam[/b] /ˈkahu.ɑm/
[b]kahúam[/b] or [b]kahûam[/b] /kɑˈhu.ɑm/
[b]kahüám[/b] /kɑhuˈɑm/
[b]kahüâm[/b] /kɑhuˈam/
