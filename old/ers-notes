- In English, referring to oneself in the third person is considered pompous. In river speech, referring to oneself in the third person is considered self-effacing.
	- Actually, referring to *anyone* in the third person is considered offensive, if they are present. What we actually have here is a first, second, third proximate, third obviative (fourth) system where the second and third proximate have merged.
	- Inanimate objects are treated identically to animate ones.
- Numbers are singular and plural, but plural derives from collective. There's also a single "indeterminate" (properly fourth, but occasionally generalized) from the * third plural. It's used when the subject is not strictly defined. (Examples: somebody, his friends. The difference between "Amazons attacked" in the indeterminate and "Amazons attacked" in the plural is something like "some of the (mentioned) Amazons attacked" versus "all of the (mentioned) Amazons attacked".)
	- There isn't an IN pronoun, but ~someone, ~anyone, etc. always take the IN.
- The difference between the perfective and imperfective aspects: I don't know how close this is to the traditional difference, but the perfective essentially sets the context to the time surrounding an event, whereas the imperfective sets the context to the event's entire duration. Hence it's patently absurd to say "after I ate" with "ate" in the imperfective.
- There is no infinitive; verbs that would take it use the verbal noun thusly: "I want to eat cake" becomes "want.PRES-1S eat.VN cake-GEN".
	- Similarly, subordinate clauses: "I know that he likes cake" becomes "know.PRES-1S 3S-ACC like.VN cake-GEN (this is a combination of the above and AcI)
	- Relative clauses are done with participles, because I want no truck with relative pronouns.
- Lative absolute. (What? It seems random in every other language...)
- The word order is essentially SVO (even in interrogatives), except that no adverbial phrases can come before the verb. This is because I don't want to deal with reordering sentences.
	- Adjectives always come after their nouns.
- Dialects:
	- Maotic, the "standard" dialect, spoken mostly along the Maoth and Cabor.
	- Kuelin, spoken north of the Cabor, in the yet unmarked plain on the map. Somewhat conservative, well attested.
	- Western, spoken nearer to the Tí river. Similar to Kuelin but poorly attested.
	- Túnic, isolated on Túna. The most conservative, with limited attestation (think Homeric.)
	- Soróké, spoken in Aspen among the lower classes, and coastally south of that. The Insular variety is (was?) spoken on Etkai Toléith, but evidence is rare. In any case it is more faithful to the original Soróké—the mainland dialect has become worn down by proximity to Maotic.
	- Billic, the most divergent, and sometimes considered another language in the Taló family. It is spoken near Akol Bílé and the Dzao.
	- Amain, spoken around the Aman, and generally closer to Soróké. The most liberal, excepting the poorly-attested Insular Soróké. Somewhat attested.
