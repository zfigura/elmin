Notes:

5. occasionally ορ/ρο for ᾰρ/ρᾰ
9. ͱ/ει/ι for ε before a vowel; ει appears sometimes before consonants
13. ἱαρός, Ἄρταμις, κα, γά, ἅτερος
16. η is very close—basically /e:/ (and in late times actually /i:/)
24. υ = /u/, and occasionally diphthongizes to /ju/ after dentals (but only once after σ, also once initially)
25. ω = ου = οː, but η is spelled ει (as 16)
