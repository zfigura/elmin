Geönian uses the Japanese/Latin syllabary. What follows are the annotated contents of ~/Documents/dragon:

606: "You will see in time"
ようゐっlせえいんちめ
(yo-u-wi-q-l-se-e-i-n-ti-me)
ようウィッlせえいn値
(yo-u-U-Ĭ-Q-l-se-e-i-n-?)

608: "At least I'm not the babysitter of you idiots"
あtれあstいmのっtへばbyしってrおfよういぢおts
(a-t-le-a-s-t-i-m-no-q-t-he-ba-b-y-si-q-te-r-o-f-yo-u-i-di-o-t-s)
ぁのt手ェばby知って炉fよういぢおts
(ă-no-t-?-Ĕ-ba-b-y-?-q-te-?-f-yo-u-i-di-o-t-s)

610: "Of course not, you're not a dragon after all. Obviously, a cutie like you can't understand this power."
おfこのちょうれのたdらごなfてらっl。おbゔぃおう、あくちえぃけようかんてゃんdぇてぃsぽうぇ。

615: "For your safety I hope that isn't a period joke"

622: "Oh great it's this bitch."

719: "There is a giant dragon that can easily carry you."
     "I hope you all set on fire."

Phoneme inventory of Geönian languages is uncertain at this time but it is known to contain the following onsets:

phi
ŋe
va
ve
lö
ske
ra
na
ro

additionally, the following codas are "attested":
l,r,s,w,g,k

vague rules:
 - no voiced stops
 - at least m,n,ŋ (dunno about phonemicity of /n/ but it has to contrast with /ŋ/)
 - lots of labials (at least m,f,v,w,p,ph, maybe mh,pf,ʙ,pt,hw, &c. certainly these will appear in non-Geönian. mh is [m̥] which Neurerge's sister Molgin also has, hw is either [ʍ] or [ɸ].
 - syllable constraints exist & will be interesting.
 - no palatal sounds, probably, even <sk> is just /sk/ (it's just really common as a cluster and gets its own set of letters. Probably no * source for it—this is entirely Geonian.)
 - vowels are where things get *really* weird. both /i/ and /u/ trigger umlaut, multiple times, and every vowel gets affected by it.
	- Length distinction is lost very quickly of course.
	- the first time this turns <a e i o u ɒ> into <ä ë ï ö ü ạ>. ạ probably represents something close to /ə/. This is basically triggered by /i u j w/ in a following syllable. (VCI or VCJV, never VI or VJ exc. VJI)
	- ë isn't quite /i/; in fact its actual identity is very curious. Not as odd as ï however which completely fails to act like any other vowel (though ë doesn't really get affected at all.)
	- high <i u ü> become <e o ö> (but not semivowels). ë occasionally becomes ạ?
	- remaining ɒ > o
	- many cases of VR > R (restoring i/u)
	- This is about where Proto-Geönian happens.
	- a couple of languages (Geönian and Elian at least, probably also Tyrälian) have a restoration phase. Probably depalatalization triggered by a, ạ.
	- Elian and Exaëlian (at least) neutralize /o/. Frankly there can be vowels shifting in general but not too much.
	- ï messes with the other vowels, in a manner which at this point depends on the language. In Elian (at least) this apparently results in ę, ą, ǫ (Polish?). Rithian (and possibly Exaëlian) have (somehow) syllables like /kju/. Geönian does something relatively tame. 
	- ạ becomes things, in a way which depends on the language.
	- Geönian, Elian, and Ziklian have a second palatalization stage, where the environment now includes JV/IV but only <a e o u> are affected. (although frankly /ji/ is hardly stable to begin with.)

The origin of the Geönian family, in case I should forget it, runs something like this: the Last Old Geonians (Reitthe and Zekial) along with Vant and Cál (Scale being trapped or dead in the pre-New-Geonian ΧΑΟΣ, Dalus possibly with the LOGs but probably not) make their way to Elmincár. (I have a hard time seeing Rift as part of the continuity at the time of this writing, so this is probably directly where they went after fleeing Old Geonia.) The language they speak—and the substrate "Tuirenna" mentions—is Geonian (without the trema.)
