* I think we've struggled before with the idea that we want magic to
  conduct/convect/radiate in certain places but not others. E.g.:

  * large bodies of magic like Namó Ablés should retain their magic forever
    (should not conduct)

  * small enchanted objects should also retain their magic? maybe not forever,
    though

  * magic energy should also be perceptible to a (skilled) magic user (implies
    that magic should radiate?)

  * on the other hand, talking about the man-made roads of Am'Caran, I don't
    think those should stick around for a very long time?

  * the idea that the soul needs to be cleaned because the environmental magic
    is leeching in and mingling with yours

  Now, with that said, the formula for the rate of heat flow (conduction) in the
  real world is:

  Q/Δt = -k * A * ΔT/Δx

  where Q/Δt is heat transfer / time; ΔT is difference in temperature, Δx is the
  thickness of the conducting material, k is its conductivity, and A is the
  surface area.

  But we can define the rate of magic transfer to be something different.
  Specifically, we can remove the ΔT component, which means that very magical
  objects (Namó Ablés, the Hearts, the Diamonds) are going to retain their magic
  forever, whereas something man-made by someone less powerful won't. We can
  also say it depends on, say, the difference in materials?

  Or maybe just objects that are charmed should be certain types of objects that
  have a low conductivity, I think that's even better, because it means you have
  to think about *what* you're enchanting. It's a twist on the usual "only
  certain materials are enchantable because they are Receptive To
  Magic"—anything *can* be enchanted, but some materials will retain that magic
  better than others.

  Is convection a thing? I'm not sure.
