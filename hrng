<twabs> but now I want to make a conlang that contrasts /ŋ/ and /ŋ˞/
<twabs> like /ŋ͡ɻ/
<twabs> whatever the hell that sound is
<twabs> I don't like either of those descriptions
<twabs> man I cannot seem to find any existing notation for this
<twabs> velar consonant with a retroflex tongue shape
<twabs> I'm p sure I can hear the difference
<twabs> but I guess it doesn't exist anywhere
<AsaBen> it might not exist naturally in any documented languages
<twabs> yeah probably not
<twabs> and granted retroflices are rly rare
<twabs> still shouldn't some dravidian language have this
<twabs> and if not that's a waste of a dravidian language
<twabs> t b h
<twabs> im gonna make a conlang that is to retroflices what slavic is to palatals
<twabs> and I will call it Hrng
<twabs> what
<twabs> how come retroflex ɬ isn't a real sound
<twabs> do I put ʈꞎ in the conlang anyway
<twabs> or do I flatten it to ʈː
<AsaBen> flatten
<twabs> I think ʈꞎ > ʈː synchronic
m n ɳ ŋ ŋ̨ [ɴ ɴ̨]
  t ʈ k k̨ q q̨
  tɬ
  l ɭ
<twabs> inventory
<twabs> + gemination
<twabs> ɴ ɴ̨ are allophonic only
<twabs> also no /p/ because B)
<twabs> oh I need /w j/
<twabs> that's what I'm missing
<twabs> and vowel inv is /e a o/
<twabs> romanizing that is going to be something
<twabs> I'm thinkin like
<twabs> isolating except kinda not
<twabs> my portuguese friend told me about how portuguese has clitic infixation and now I want to do it in a conlang
<twabs> "eu o destruirei" = "eu destruirei lo" = "eu destruiloei"
<twabs> "I destroyed it"
<twabs> destru-i=lo=ei
<twabs> it only happens in future and... pluperfect I think?
<twabs> hrng should have like
<twabs> this but eroded
<twabs> so that the position of a clitic is the only signifier of tense
<twabs> like tatɬewiq̨aya "I drove them" vs witatɬeqaya "I drive them"
<twabs> tatɬe "drive"
<twabs> -qaya 1SG
<twabs> -wi 3SG.OBJ

I have said some contradictory things here. Let's figure out a way to make them
simultaneously true.

* I think the only affixes I want are personal.

* ɽ > ɳ, so that explains the loss of ɽ

* SVO

* No morphosyntactic TAM except for present/past.

* Not simply nom-acc. Instead... split ergative, but with separate NOM and ERG
  cases?

I don't really want to mark case on nouns, but I'm okay with doing a Japanese.

Let's just write out some sentences:

tatlewiqaya "I drove them"

- tatle "drive"
- wi 3SG.OBJ
- qaya 1SG

tatɬeyoɴqaya "they drove me"

- yoŋ 3SG.NOM

ḳotaqau "I spoke"

- ḳota "speak"
- qau 1SG (alternate form)

ṭewaṭaenema "they mend it"

- ṭe 3SG.N.OBJ
- waṭae "mend"
- nema 3SG.ERG

mengeq̣oṭe "it broke"

- mengeq̣o "break"

* verb serialization via compounding, such that it allows verbs to become
  transitive. not unlike greek or english but with other verbs instead of
  prepositions

ṭowaḳotawiḳama "you said to him"

- ṭowa "face <verb>"
- ḳama 2SG.NOM


so the basic idea is that we have NOM, ERG, OBJ cases, split ergativity based on
presence of a 1st or 2nd person.

no, we need a fourth case. the fourth case is passive. now I like this

waṭaeṭṭaye "it was mended"

- ṭṭa(ye) 3SG.N.PASS


we need a bit of diachrony/synchrony:

* pre-language has *ɽ, /a e i o u/ and CV

* o > ø
* Cl > tl
* p > ø
* C > rC / _r, r_
* r > n / V_{e}
* r > ɳ / V_{a,o,u}
* l > n / _C
* r > ø
* e > a / stressed
* i u > e o
* delete final /e a/ if the word has more than two syllables? this is probably synchronic

* there is not much of a preposition/verb distinction. there are a few
  positional verbs which are basically also prepositions: yiwa "be on top of",
  ṭa "be behind", ayao "be under", weṭeṭo "be around, enclose", tame "move
  around, circle", taqa "move into", moɳala "move up, climb". more metaphorical
  prepositions tend to derive from other verbs; there is a decent amount of
  lexical metaphor: eḳone "count" -> "about, relating to", sometimes benefactive
  "for"; weyo "give" -> "to, towards", sometimes benefactive "for".

* Verbs which are not the head verb (or compounded with it) are preceded by a
  particle ṇgo. I don't know what the proper name for this kind of particle is.
  It's not really a conjuction because adverbs and other stuff modifying the
  main verb can still follow a non-head verbal clause. In a sense I guess this
  is a gerund-like participle. It's basically English "that" but it can be used
  to modify anything

* There is an animate/inanimate distinction. Substantive endings are:

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  ḷoḳen  ewe
 - OBJ  Ø      e
 - ERG  ka     e
 - PASS ṇeṭa   eṭṭa(ye)

* What do I translate? I'm kind of conflicted here. To make a good post I should
  be inventing a new text, ideally one that reveals something about the cultural
  context of Hrng. But part of the thing right now is that I don't really want
  to add any context to this language—no siblings, no parent, no conworlding,
  and just enough diachronics to make the words look less bad.


---

let's fill out the cases. Copied from above, non-pronouns:

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  ḷoḳen  eu
 - OBJ  Ø      e
 - ERG  ka     e
 - PASS ṇeṭa   eṭṭa(ye)

3sg:

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  yoŋ    ṭewe/teu
 - OBJ  wi     ṭe
 - ERG  nema   ṭe
 - PASS ŋ̣eṭa   eṭṭa(ye)

2sg:

        ANIM
 - NOM  ḳama
 - OBJ  naq̣e

1sg: qaya (or alternate form qau) NOM/OBJ. Passive constructions with 1SG and
2SG can't really be done. This implies that what we really have here is more of
a split direct/inverse.

Note that many of these are regularly affected by final vowel deletion, but the
inanimate passive is not (it does not become **-eṭṭ nor **-eṭṭai).

---

the internal name is:

  - yaṇg (ḷeṇom) which is historically a name for the dialect spoken in the city
    of Yaṇg (Maotic: Uenter)

    - borrowed into some Tavarian dialect as Yarng, later reduced to Hrng

    - borrowed into some Maotic as Yangharad (yaŋ + harad "plains". Not sure why
      since the language is spoken in the mountains. Maybe harad is a
      bastardization of some other element?)

      - borrowed back into Hrng as yanngalat (or yanngawat? Actually I think l
        -> w is a dialectal feature)

further notes:

  * split ergativity is based on the presence of a first or second person, but
    notably that doesn't have to be as the direct subject or object of the
    relevant clause; it can be a dependent clause (or a dependent clause's
    controller) or even just a nearby clause.

    This is partly to make this a bit more interesting than "erg/abs with a
    direct/inverse contrast bolted on top".

chol has nom=erg and acc=abs. (for reference, the subject of an intransitive is
nom or abs)

I realize I slightly forgot about the clitic infixation part and also I don't
know how word order works in general


ṭeṇ ṇgo wimatatanema ṇgo naṭeṭ keḷeḷ ṇiwe nanga?
why that 3SG.OBJ-raise-3SG.ERG that lack mother and father

ṭeṇ? ṭeṇ

Because Yangharad is a Mittelo-Tavarian language it behoves us to work out some
of the details of its neighbours.

Mittelo-Tavarian is a mess. Like, a huge mess. Northern Germany/Netherlands is
the model here. In the case of Agrócár it's largely a problem because the
language of trade and of the higher class is Maotic. This displaced High
Tavarian, but among the outskirts and lower classes you still see an awful
fragmentation of High Tavarian dialects spoken, including Qhuraal and Myrve (I
*think* these are High Tavarian dialects proper, but I'm not sure.)

The trade road from Talócár to western Agrócár runs straight through <city I
don't remember the name of> and Sevrós. Here you see the same pattern; in the
former case you have Low Tavarian, which was pretty well displaced by Maotic,
and in the latter Inner Mittelic which is less displaced *yet*. In both cases
modern Mittelo-Tavarian dialects survive but are fragmented.

To the northwest you have Toi-Kántr and Fír-Kántr; to the southeast Étéïc
Tavarian.


The presence of uvulars is an areal feature of High Tavarian. (It should also
definitely fuck up a Maotic dialect.)
