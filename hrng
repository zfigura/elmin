<twabs> but now I want to make a conlang that contrasts /ŋ/ and /ŋ˞/
<twabs> like /ŋ͡ɻ/
<twabs> whatever the hell that sound is
<twabs> I don't like either of those descriptions
<twabs> man I cannot seem to find any existing notation for this
<twabs> velar consonant with a retroflex tongue shape
<twabs> I'm p sure I can hear the difference
<twabs> but I guess it doesn't exist anywhere
<AsaBen> it might not exist naturally in any documented languages
<twabs> yeah probably not
<twabs> and granted retroflices are rly rare
<twabs> still shouldn't some dravidian language have this
<twabs> and if not that's a waste of a dravidian language
<twabs> t b h
<twabs> im gonna make a conlang that is to retroflices what slavic is to palatals
<twabs> and I will call it Hrng
<twabs> what
<twabs> how come retroflex ɬ isn't a real sound
<twabs> do I put ʈꞎ in the conlang anyway
<twabs> or do I flatten it to ʈː
<AsaBen> flatten
<twabs> I think ʈꞎ > ʈː synchronic
m n ɳ ŋ ŋ̨ [ɴ ɴ̨]
  t ʈ k k̨ q q̨
  tɬ
  l ɭ
<twabs> inventory
<twabs> + gemination
<twabs> ɴ ɴ̨ are allophonic only
<twabs> also no /p/ because B)
<twabs> oh I need /w j/
<twabs> that's what I'm missing
<twabs> and vowel inv is /e a o/
<twabs> romanizing that is going to be something
<twabs> I'm thinkin like
<twabs> isolating except kinda not
<twabs> my portuguese friend told me about how portuguese has clitic infixation and now I want to do it in a conlang
<twabs> "eu o destruirei" = "eu destruirei lo" = "eu destruiloei"
<twabs> "I destroyed it"
<twabs> destru-i=lo=ei
<twabs> it only happens in future and... pluperfect I think?
<twabs> hrng should have like
<twabs> this but eroded
<twabs> so that the position of a clitic is the only signifier of tense
<twabs> like tatɬewiq̨aya "I drove them" vs witatɬeqaya "I drive them"
<twabs> tatɬe "drive"
<twabs> -qaya 1SG
<twabs> -wi 3SG.OBJ

============
MORPHOSYNTAX
============

Hrng historically had an erg-abs alignment, but then syncretism happened in some
(most?) places. As a result it basically started innovating a direct/inverse
system on top of this.

The upshot is that there are now four cases. If a SAP is present, the language
is basically nom/acc; otherwise it's erg/abs. acc = abs but nom != erg. Also
there's a passive marker.

One curious aspect of this is that this "is a SAP present" condition is actually
starting to bleed over into other clauses. Usually this will apply to dependent
clauses of the same sentence, but it can even apply to neighbouring clauses.
I.e. if a neighbouring clause or sentence has a SAP present, the clause might
switch into nom/acc even if it doesn't have a SAP itself.

Verbs mark obligatorily (sort of) for two TAM-like categories, and they also
mark for person. In the latter case Hrng is basically in the process of slurping
up personal pronouns.

The personal pronouns are:

3sg:

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  kewe   ṭewe/teu
 - OBJ  ken    ṭe
 - ERG  wi     ṭe
 - PASS wiṭa   eṭṭa(ye)

2sg:

        ANIM
 - NOM  nema
 - OBJ  naq̣e (or just na?)
(- PASS neṭa?)

1sg: yoŋ NOM/OBJ. Passive constructions with 1SG (and 2SG?) can't really be
done.

Verbal forms are:

* -qaya (or alternate form qau) indicative;

* -qaqaya iterative;

* -to "gnomic"

* -leq.a optative

* -ŋi conative or inchoative

Conditionals are marked with a different particle ŋo but still takes a mood. The
same particle is used for conjoining subordinate clauses which are not
conditionals, much like English "that". It *can* have an irrealis force but does
not really...

The other TAM thing is sort of questionably grammaticalized. Basically this is
the Portuguese thing. The Portuguese thing is transparently derived from verbal
periphrasis that got elided. In our case, Hrng is already known to compound
verbs aggressively, and this is no exception. The verb for the past tense is the
one that got elided, but there are some others:

* tan "want to do"

* teṭo "stop doing"

* wane "do repeatedly, keep doing"

* ṇet "can do" ~ "will do"

When verbs are compounded, personal pronouns go right before the last verb.

Hence the order of a verb is:

  OBJ PRONOUN - NOM/ERG PRONOUN - root - ENDING

or, when a grammaticalized verb is used:

  root - OBJ PRONOUN - NOM/ERG PRONOUN - (manner verb) - ENDING

Other compounds however may go in front:

  compound (e.g. direction) - PRONOUNS - root - ENDING

or even

  direction - root - PRONOUNS - (manner verb) - ENDING

======
SYNTAX
======

* Passive constructions take a verb as normal and a noun in the passive case.
  There is a native way to express passive agent ("by X") but I'm not sure what
  it is. Colloquial Yangharad however borrows the Maotic construction of using a
  preposition (Maotic "hor X", hor "around" > "by", not quite sure how yangharad
  does prepositions yet actually so can't translate this yet) but this competes
  with the older method.

* Broadly SVO but with some freedom to front.

* Broadly pro-drop.

===========
SYNCHRONICS
===========

* CVj, CVw > Ci, Cu

* l > w

* delete final /e a/ if the word has more than two syllables? this is probably synchronic

* there is not much of a preposition/verb distinction. there are a few
  positional verbs which are basically also prepositions: yiwa "be on top of",
  ṭa "be behind", ayao "be under", weṭeṭo "be around, enclose", tame "move
  around, circle", taqa "move into", moṇala "move up, climb". more metaphorical
  prepositions tend to derive from other verbs; there is a decent amount of
  lexical metaphor: eḳone "count" -> "about, relating to", sometimes benefactive
  "for"; weyo "give" -> "to, towards", sometimes benefactive "for".

ṭeṇ ŋ.o kemimatatato n.ewe ŋ.o naṭeṭṭo keḷeḷ ṇiwe naŋa?
why that 3A.OBJ-3A.ERG-raise-AOR child that lack-AOR mother and father

	* there is not a strong difference between "ten" and "ten ŋo". I think
          the latter is a bit older

	* synchronic -nw- > -m-

	* yangharad is not *quite* at the stage where pronouns are given
          redundantly with object nouns, but it's probably close, such that it's
          sometimes done

ṭeṇ? ṭeṇ keŋ.o mat ŋ.o witeṭoto?
