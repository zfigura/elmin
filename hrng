<twabs> man I cannot seem to find any existing notation for this

<AsaBen> it might not exist naturally in any documented languages

<twabs> "I destroyed it"
<twabs> destru-i=lo=ei
<twabs> it only happens in future and... pluperfect I think?
<twabs> hrng should have like

PHONOLOGY
=========

Not changed from the above.

m n ɳ ŋ ŋ̨ [ɴ ɴ̨]
  t ʈ k k̨ q q̨
  [tɬ]
w l ɭ y

The vowels are /a e i o u/, diphthongs /oi au eu/, but the existence of /i u/ is
a bit questionable. Before a vowel they become -ay- -ow-, suggesting that that
is their underlying representation. [Maybe loanwords break this, though.]

Synchronically tɬ isn't a phoneme. (I kind of want to change this, but I'm not
going to redo the translation or lexicon at this state.)

Retroflicization is henceforth marked with a dot (below, except for ŋ q since
they have a descender). Since that doesn't render nicely for everything, and is
a bit of a pain to type, it's also marked with a dot following the letter.

Some notes, though:

* In practice both of /l ḷ/ have merged with [w] in central Yangharad dialects.
  Probably some minor outlying dialects retain the old pronunciation. (What
  about tɬ? Is it too insane to have [tɬ] but no [l]? Does it become /f/?)

* Final /a e/ are usually not pronounced if the word has more than two
  syllables.

* There is a decent amount of synchrony. Here are some of the rules:

  - if one member of a cluster is retroflicized, both are (exc. /m/ of course)

  - stop + l > tɬ.

  - However, stop + l > ṭṭ if retroflicized.

  - stop1 + stop2 > stop2 geminate

  - l + stop > n + stop

  - nasals assimilate in general

  - n + w > m (not geminate!)

  - stop + nasal metathesizes

  - stop + y is left alone

  - stop + w is left alone, I'm pretty sure. It's very possible that /tw/ is
    pronounced [pw] or even [p]. (Modulo voicing. What is voicing like in Hrng?)

  - others are not worked out

  - vowel hiatus is generally fine, but ee dissimilates to ae. -aa- and -oo- do
    not dissimilate. -oo- is pronounced with a medial -w- though.

  - i + vowel or u + vowel is at least spelled -ayV- or -owV-. Note though that
    some words have -iyV-, -uwV-, -iwV-, -uyV-; underlyingly this is -yy-, -ww-,
    -yw-, -wy-.

============
MORPHOSYNTAX
============

Hrng historically had an erg-abs alignment, but then syncretism happened in some
(most?) places. As a result it basically started innovating a direct/inverse
system on top of this.

The upshot is that there are now four cases. If a SAP is present, the language
is basically nom/acc; otherwise it's erg/abs. acc = abs but nom != erg. Also
there's a passive marker.

One curious aspect of this is that this "is a SAP present" condition is actually
starting to bleed over into other clauses. Usually this will apply to dependent
clauses of the same sentence, but it can even apply to neighbouring clauses.
I.e. if a neighbouring clause or sentence has a SAP present, the clause might
switch into nom/acc even if it doesn't have a SAP itself.

Verbs mark obligatorily (sort of) for two TAM-like categories, and they also
mark for person. In the latter case Hrng is basically in the process of slurping
up personal pronouns.

The personal pronouns are:

3sg:

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  kewe   ṭewe/teu
 - OBJ  ken    ṭe
 - ERG  wi     ṭe
 - PASS wiṭa   eṭṭa(ye)

3pl:

        ANIM    INAN
 - NOM  keṇṭewe neṇṭeu(e)
 - OBJ  keṇṭe   nen
 - ERG  yat     nen
 - PASS yaṭṭa   neṇṭa(ye)

2sg:

        ANIM
 - NOM  nema
 - OBJ  naq.e (or just na?)
(- PASS neṭa?)

2pl:

        ANIM
 - NOM  omato
 - OBJ  omaqe (or slightly leveled omaq.e)
(- PASS omaṭa?)

1sg: yoŋ NOM/OBJ. Passive constructions with 1SG (and 2SG?) can't really be
done.

1pl: qale NOM/OBJ.

Case endings for normal nouns or adjectives (I deleted these at some point and
I'm not sure why. I'd rather thave them back especially since I think the words
could afford to be longer for aesthetic purposes.):

        ANIM   INAN
 - NOM  -(e)we -eu
 - OBJ  -Ø     -e
 - ERG  -ka    -e
 - PASS -ṭa    -eṭṭa(ye)

Nouns also mark for pluralization, with an ending -wane- which precedes case.

Those nominative and passive endings probably have complicated implications
about diachronic stress patterns, which I am going to just neglect to address.

I think that inanimates always end in -e. Adjectives take animate or inanimate
endings, though, and in that case the -e- actually replaces the final vowel.

Verbal forms are:

* -qaya (or alternate form qau) indicative;

* -qaqaya iterative;

* -to "gnomic"

* -leq.a optative

* -ŋi conative or inchoative

Conditionals are marked with a different particle ŋo but still takes a mood. The
same particle is used for conjoining subordinate clauses which are not
conditionals, much like English "that". It *can* have an irrealis force but does
not really...

The other TAM thing is sort of questionably grammaticalized. Basically this is
the Portuguese thing. The Portuguese thing is transparently derived from verbal
periphrasis that got elided. In our case, Hrng is already known to compound
verbs aggressively, and this is no exception. The verb for the past tense is the
one that got elided, but there are some others:

* tan "want to do"

* teṭo "stop doing"

* wane "do repeatedly, keep doing"

* ṇet "can do" ~ "will do"

When verbs are compounded, personal pronouns go right before the last verb.

Hence the order of a verb is:

  OBJ PRONOUN - NOM/ERG PRONOUN - root - ENDING

or, when a grammaticalized verb is used:

  root - OBJ PRONOUN - NOM/ERG PRONOUN - (manner verb) - ENDING

Other compounds however may go in front:

  compound (e.g. direction) - PRONOUNS - root - ENDING

or even

  direction - root - PRONOUNS - (manner verb) - ENDING

======
SYNTAX
======

* Passive constructions take a verb as normal and a noun in the passive case.
  There is a native way to express passive agent ("by X") but I'm not sure what
  it is. Colloquial Yangharad however borrows the Maotic construction of using a
  preposition (Maotic "hor X", hor "around" > "by", not quite sure how yangharad
  does prepositions yet actually so can't translate this yet) but this competes
  with the older method.

* Broadly SVO but with some freedom to front.

* Broadly pro-drop.

* there is not much of a preposition/verb distinction. there are a few
  positional verbs which are basically also prepositions: yiwa "be on top of",
  ṭa "be behind", ayao "be under", weṭeṭo "be around, enclose", tame "move
  around, circle", taqa "move into", moṇala "move up, climb". more metaphorical
  prepositions tend to derive from other verbs; there is a decent amount of
  lexical metaphor: eḳone "count" -> "about, relating to", sometimes benefactive
  "for"; weyo "give" -> "to, towards", sometimes benefactive "for".

t.en. ŋ.o kenyatweyon.aq.ato n.ewe ŋ.o nat.et.t.o kel.el. n.iwe naŋa?
why that 3SG.AN.OBJ-3PL.AN.ERG-give-feed-AOR child-OBJ that lack-AOR mother-OBJ and father-OBJ

	* there is not a strong difference between "ten" and "ten ŋo". I think
          the latter is a bit older

	* synchronic -nw- > -m-

	* yangharad is not *quite* at the stage where pronouns are given
          redundantly with object nouns, but it's probably close, such that it's
          sometimes done

	* the use of the aorist would be a bit odd. in this case it fits because
          the speaker wants to give a strong framing of, y'know, "the system", a
          gnome quality of what they do, by nature.

	* the use of the aorist in "lack" is... also perhaps not the most usual,
          but I think it's there partly because the sentence already had one,
          or possibly just because a child lacks its parents for, well, most of
          its life

	* I originally used the verb matata 'raise' here, but it ends up being a
          bit phonologically ridiculous: yat + matata + to = yantatatato

t.en.? t.en. keŋ.o mat ŋ.o yattet.oto?
why any thing.OBJ that 3PL.AN.ERG-do-AOR?

	* keŋ.o is an adverb

ŋen.a, wot.a, ŋen.a mat ŋ.o n.aŋelok.ato
it's, well, it's thing.OBJ that unclear-mind-AOR

	* ŋeṇa is an odd particle. I translate it as "it's" or "there's". I
          think historically it was a verb, but it doesn't act like one anymore.
          It basically always is word-initial. It could kind of be translated as
          simply "there", but it has a bit more of a force of "it exists".
          Yangharad doesn't have a copula quite as eroded as many languages, but
          ŋeṇa kind of fills that gap in some ways by providing a way to soften
          another verb into "it's there" rather than putting the focus on the
          verb's active or stative meaning.

          In older generations, such as this, I think ŋeṇa *does* act a bit more
          like a verb, at least in that it's regularly followed by a noun, and
          if the noun needs further specification then it'll be followed by ŋo.
          But somewhere between old and new ŋo just ends up being left out.

	* this is a bit interesting. I'm not sure how lexical vs grammatical
          "mat" is, but even if it is more lexical, I think this is the right
          way to translate it. the source probably means "it's insanity" as
          "the whole of what they do is insanity" but I don't think it's wrong
          for it to be "this specific thing is insanity".

          I specifically translated this phrasing, instead of the simpler "ŋeṇa
          ṇaŋeloḳa" to try to capture the difference between "it's insane" and
          "it's insanity".

	* I never thought about this before but I think Yangharad has some
          morphological derivation going on. Not like * does by any means
          though. I'm debating between giving that verbalizer a suffix (-yo-
          mb?) and leaving it as is. It's probably a recent process though so if
          it's a suffix it should be from clear analogy.

but however, system-ERG 3PL.AN.OBJ-3SG.IN.ERG-for-behave-AOR

	* A maqeqeqaete is a water-engine. Possibly it's a simple mechanical
          water-wheel, but probably it has some magical aspect that I should
          think about and work out when I'm not so tired. Metaphorically though
          it can easily mean "device, machine", and hence "system" as here.

	* In fact the metaphorical use is so strong that instead of tame "turn",
          the word qaweq.a "flow, behave" is used instead.

	* I actually don't know what the original intent of the benefactive is:
          either "works fine for them" or "works for" as in English one person
          "works for" another, and Yangharad actually distinguishes the two
          (it's close enough to the distinction between "eḳone" and "weyo"). I
          suspect it's the former, though, because the next sentence seeks to
          explain why, whereas I would expect the latter to be presented as a
          gnomic truth without explanation.

	* Unlike English (though not that unlike English), and perhaps more like
          Greek, the fact that the preposition is glommed onto the verb doesn't
          so much affect the base meaning of the verb. It's just how
          prepositions work in Yangharad. (What if it was a transitive verb like
          "tell him for me"? Well, you'd have to phrase it differently.)

	* The subject is redundant but I think that subjects are always
          specified when the object pronoun is glommed onto the verb.

	* Yangharad is perfectly fine with hiatus, but I don't think it much
          likes hiatus of the same vowel? Maybe -aa- is fine but -ee- isn't.
          -ee- becomes -ae-. -oo- might also be fine, but in practice is
          probably pronounced [owo].

	* Just realized that the rule above is that pronouns go before the last
          verb in a compound (which would yield ek.oneken.t.eqaweq.ato). I'm not
          sure if I like that rule, I might reverse it.

	* Translating "own" by instead adding a demonstrative for emphasis.

	* Uh... we still need a way to translate "their" though. In fact in
          general we need a way to express possessives or relation though.
          Should we retcon a genitive into the language after all? A
          preposition? Are there other ways to do this I don't know?

          WALS chapter 60 gives another idea (Jewish Arbel Aramaic) which is to
          use a preposition, but specifically to make it the same as the
          relative preposition. This is very rare, though.

          Worth noting that Maotic collapses genitives and adjectives. I think
          that this may be the *nascent* answer (again, in general Yangharad is
          becoming more compounding / polysynthetic anyway) but it's not the old
          approach.

          I don't think the old approach is a genitive case. I don't want to add
          another case and I don't think that a case would be easily lost, not
          when in the past few hundred years Yangharad gained a case. I think it
          should be something separate from the preposition *and* separate from
          a bare noun. We could use a his-genitive but I don't quite like this
          either.

          I think the right answer is an adposition/conjunction (basically, one
          of the few true ones this language has). One that's not ŋo. This is a
          very common cross-linguistic way to do it. It shouldn't be a case—it
          doesn't participate in agreement. In fact, apparently Egyptian Arabic
          has an adposition which itself agrees with its head noun, which I
          like. So let's do that.
