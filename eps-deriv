THINGS WE KNOW PROTO-* HAS:
---------------------------

* The glottal-stop

* Palatalization, I think on all or most consonants.

  - Consonants are always palatal before /i/ but may not necessarily be palatal
    after /i/.

  - The glottal stop can, I think, be palatalized.

* One nasal.

  - Taol and M-T add a POA distinction to this nasal. *fruit turns it into
    nasalized vowels and regains nasals from voiced consonants. Kyndae may very
    well keep it verbatim. Geonian might do something insane like deleting the
    nasal in initials but keeping it in finals. [We have a Geonian name
    "Zûtsimazôn" but that could be m < mp or something? Oh but then again we
    have "Memorizôn". And Baerloni. Still worth thinking about.]

* What phonotactics? [Do a North American approach to this, *some* combinations
  are avoided or result in metathesis/elision/epenthesis.]

  - CʔVʔC does not appear in roots. It can potentially appear in derived words;
    some descendants prefer to avoid it though. Taol possibly has no objection
    to it.

  - CʔR is invalid and I think we actually lose R in this case. R does not
    include nasals though; CʔN is just fine.

  - ʔNʔ is invalid and becomes Nʔ.

* Originally I put /s/ in it but I don't think it's necessary and I'd rather
  avoid it.

  - Where does Taol's s come from? Actually almost all of the instances of it
    are in coda position, where /r/ doesn't happen, so that pretty nicely solves
    that problem. We do however have hesó. (Also a couple of Agrócárian cities
    beginning with /s/ but that's not really interesting.)

* No uvulars. M-T has them but I have a note that M-T gets them from kʲ k > k q.
  I stand by this because it avoids letting P* get too sinky. Also because I
  think M-T is the only branch that has them *anyway*.

  - Where does Taol's ʁ come from? Should I just put it in P*? I did originally
    make this uvular and had it yield Taol ʁ (regardless of voicing, which is
    necessary to explain the difference in length), but I don't want P* to have
    uvular obstruents as described above. Although I do kind of like the idea of
    this phoneme inexplicably yielding /g/ in some places. Maybe I just make it
    ʁ. I'll write it as capital *G for now. And kind of ad-hoc its phonotactics.

* Three vowels /a i u/, BUT strong front/back allophony based on palatalization.
  In fact, I think what we basically have is /a~ɑ i~ɯ y~u/ aka Triangular
  Turkish. Taol loses palatalization and turns this into a proper system,
  gradually shifting /ɯ y u/ to /e u o/. *fruit keeps palatalization and leaves
  the vowel system as it is. M-T leaves the vowel system alone (probably?) but
  also loses palatalization mostly. Kyndae keeps palatalization (well, kinda),
  dunno what it does to vowels. I dunno about *fish either.

MISC NOTES:
-----------

* Disappearance of glottal stop and associated changes (ʔT -> D, Vʔ > V:, Tʔ >
  Tʰ) is a change shared across at least Taol, Mittelo-Tavarian, *fruit. It is
  not part of Kyndae, which has a different resolution, or of Geönian or *fish,
  which haven't been worked out yet.

  - What else happens to these? ʔC > ʔ is interesting and actually seems to be
    one of the most common things to happen to preglottalized consonants.
    Geonian angle.

  - Idea stolen from some allospherian is ʔC > ʔəC and/or vice versa wrt order.
    This can give away a lot of the game but if we hide it well enough I don't
    hate it. (Such as by then killing the glottal stop...) This could be *fish.

  - I originally had Taol retain "preglottalization" as a contrast instead of
    just voicing, that might be excessive though, especially if this is supposed
    to be shared with other branches. (In particular if we want Kyndae to get a
    voicing contrast...)

* Proto-* is a synthetic (but not polysynthetic) language with very short
  affixes (less than a syllable). Tavarian retains this and is varying degrees
  of fusional. Kyndae is fully fusional. Taol drops this; it is entirely
  isolating in terms of morphology and is mostly isolating in derivation as well
  (all endings are nonproductive). Some compounds are traditionally written as
  one word (Elmincár) but there's not really any reason they need to be.

  - generating word lists for this is going to be hell. Do I give it something
    like a CCVCC (maximal) syllable shape (with maximum disyllabic roots) and
    then do short affixes of random shape? Most clustery roots I have here are
    tlaytʔ "tree" and aʔkriʔ "left". That first one is probably excessive
    though, and we *know* that Maotic drops short finals. So let's retcon that
    to tlaytʔa.

    I think we still have maximally CCVCC roots though, just some rules that
    avoid overly complex clusters.

* Earlier models of P* gave it a 5-vowel system; I don't like this anymore. I
  think Taol's weird-ass vowel system makes a lot more sense derived from a
  3-vowel system with a contrast introduced from some neighbouring attribute. I
  think I had kind of done the a/A harmony with palatalization and I think it
  makes the most sense to extend that.

  - actually there's a note on the old eps_roots document saying "it is likely
    that * had no phonemic difference between e and i; all the words we have
    have raise e > i before n or s". I like the vowel harmony thing better but
    we could borrow this for later? Maybe Maotic raises those vowels again
    later.

Changes for Taol:

- ʔʲ > y when not blocked by a consonant. shared with others. in fact this may
  not even be a real distinction in the first place? hmm, except maybe some
  kyndae series should come from Cy-

- Southern consonant resolution

- break some clusters with ɑ?

- nasals

  * Shared with M-T. That said, I need to figure out the contrast here. List of
    words includes: agróme, alóné, elmin, in, namó, émaor, melith, maot (Maoth,
    Maotel). Also probably-Taol names Aman, Aspen, and probably-M-T names
    Mentos, Málat. My original condition was /m/ word-initially and before /n/
    but that's violated by agróme (but that could be a compound?), namó, and
    émaor. So perhaps the condition should be /m/ word-initially and before back
    vowels, which I think actually fits perfectly? And is a lot more reasonable.

- vowels /a i u/ lowered to /ɑ e o/ exc. before palatals. note that /aj ij/ stay
  /aj i:/ but /uj/ becomes /oj/ just because dissimilation

  - This is questionable, because we have the following rule. This is here to
    satisfy P* *itkuy > Maotic etkai, but maybe that's questionable anyway.
    Well, not so much because of the cluster—we have actó anyway and I'd rather
    be consistent in that respect—but it does conflict with tlaytʔa > tlāitha.
    Probably a better approach is Taol *etkašiš < P* *itkatʲitʲ.

- diphthongs in -i epenthesize a glottal stop (tlaytʔa > tlaʔitʔa > tlāitha).
  this is probably early and possibly shared

- loss of glottal stop and compensatory lengthening of preceding vowels,
  including in the Szemerényi position (VRH > V:R). Does this precede or follow
  the next rule? Adjust the generator probably since we *should* have more words
  with syllabic vowels. I mean, if the phonotactics of P* are "meh" we should do
  it right.

- m= n= r= R= l= > um in ir ɑR ɑl

- t > š / _{ʲ, i, u} unless blocked by /n/

- voicing of C in VCRV [under some conditions?] Hence aplirʔ > aplēs > ablēs,
  akʲr-uʔ > acró > agró. However atʲlur > atlos > atlas. Is this a later
  compound? Adjectivalizer in at-? (Should we give atlas a literal meaning more
  complex than "big" then? At least originally.)

  Actually atlas is kind of broken anyway because atʲ should become aš. This
  needs a better etymology

- nr > dr

- grassman's law (CʰVCʰ > CVCʰ)

- long vowels shorten before another long vowel

- Most instances of CN end up dropping the nasal I think. Maotic does not like
  that cluster. (Taol more generally might be fine with it.) bn might be fine?
