THINGS WE KNOW PROTO-* HAS:
---------------------------

* The glottal-stop

* Palatalization, I think on all or most consonants.

  - Consonants are always palatal before /i/ but may not necessarily be palatal
    after /i/.

  - The glottal stop can, I think, be palatalized.

* One nasal.

  - Taol and M-T add a POA distinction to this nasal. *fruit turns it into
    nasalized vowels and regains nasals from voiced consonants. Kyndae may very
    well keep it verbatim. Geonian might do something insane like deleting the
    nasal in initials but keeping it in finals. [We have a Geonian name
    "Zûtsimazôn" but that could be m < mp or something? Oh but then again we
    have "Memorizôn". And Baerloni. Still worth thinking about.]

* What phonotactics? [Do a North American approach to this, *some* combinations
  are avoided or result in metathesis/elision/epenthesis. E.g. CʔVʔC is avoided
  but I don't know what happens to it.]

* Originally I put /s/ in it but I don't think it's necessary and I'd rather
  avoid it.

  - Where does Taol's s come from? Actually almost all of the instances of it
    are in coda position, where /r/ doesn't happen, so that pretty nicely solves
    that problem. We do however have hesó. (Also a couple of Agrócárian cities
    beginning with /s/ but that's not really interesting.)

* No uvulars. M-T has them but I have a note that M-T gets them from kʲ k > k q.
  I stand by this because it avoids letting P* get too sinky. Also because I
  think M-T is the only branch that has them *anyway*.

  - Where does Taol's ʁ come from? Should I just put it in P*? I did originally
    make this uvular and had it yield Taol ʁ (regardless of voicing, which is
    necessary to explain the difference in length), but I don't want P* to have
    uvular obstruents as described above. Although I do kind of like the idea of
    this phoneme inexplicably yielding /g/ in some places. Maybe I just make it
    ʁ.

MISC NOTES:
-----------

* Disappearance of glottal stop and associated changes (ʔT -> D, Vʔ > V:, Tʔ >
  Tʰ) is a change shared across at least Taol, Mittelo-Tavarian, *fruit. It is
  not part of Geönian or *fish. It *might* be part of Kyndae

* Proto-* is a synthetic (but not polysynthetic) language with very short
  affixes (less than a syllable). Tavarian retains this and is varying degrees
  of fusional. Kyndae is fully fusional. Taol drops this; it is entirely
  isolating in terms of morphology and is mostly isolating in derivation as well
  (all endings are nonproductive). Some compounds are traditionally written as
  one word (Elmincár) but there's not really any reason they need to be.

* Earlier models of P* gave it a 5-vowel system; I don't like this anymore. I
  think Taol's weird-ass vowel system makes a lot more sense derived from a
  3-vowel system with a contrast introduced from some neighbouring attribute. I
  think I had kind of done the a/A harmony with palatalization and I think it
  makes the most sense to extend that.

  - actually there's a note on the old eps_roots document saying "it is likely
    that * had no phonemic difference between e and i; all the words we have
    have raise e > i before n or s". I like the vowel harmony thing better but
    we could borrow this for later? Maybe Maotic raises those vowels again
    later.

Changes for Taol:

- Southern consonant resolution

- nasals

  * Shared with M-T. That said, I need to figure out the contrast here. List of
    words includes: agróme, alóné, elmin, in, namó, émaor, melith, maot (Maoth,
    Maotel). Also probably-Taol names Aman, Aspen, and probably-M-T names
    Mentos, Málat. My original condition was /m/ word-initially and before /n/
    but that's violated by agróme (but that could be a compound?), namó, and
    émaor. So perhaps the condition should be /m/ word-initially and before back
    vowels, which I think actually fits perfectly? And is a lot more reasonable.

- vowels /a i u/ lowered to /ɑ e o/ exc. before palatals. note that /aj ij/ stay
  /aj i:/ but /uj/ becomes /oj/ just because dissimilation

- break some clusters with ɑ

- t > š / _{i, u} unless blocked by /n/

- voicing of C in VCRV [under some conditions?] Hence aplirʔ > aplēs > ablēs,
  akʲr-uʔ > acró > agró. However atʲlur > atlos > atlas...
