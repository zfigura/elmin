\begin{document}

The following excerpts are taken from treatises published by Chásur\footnote{Classical Maotic \textipa{/k\super{j}\super{h}a:suK/}, Modern \textipa{/C\super{h}as5/} or Dálx \textipa{/h\textsubumlaut{E}sO/}.}. The excerpts are cited by title, treatise number, and author. The somewhat unfortunate practice for academic publications established by Chásur is to give the treatise a single word title describing the subject in the broadest sense, followed by a number distinguishing which identically titled publication by the same author is being cited.
