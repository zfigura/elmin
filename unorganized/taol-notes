I think the secret to conlanging is to drop your own work, leave almost no notes on it, then come back to it after a year and reconstruct it.

I have a table full of words and their correspondences in several languages, and now I'm stuck with the task of figuring out what exactly the sound change rules are. And the languages themselves.

I am going to talk about phonology, because contrary to popular belief, phonology is actually fun and interesting. Fucking fight me.

So, starting from the Taol family:

The phonology of Maotic has already been described, but I'm going to expand on it a bit.

* Realization of <c> varies. In Kuelin it's always kʲ, but outside of that (even in Western dialects) ts, in backwater Makóké /s/.

* Early Maotic basically had two diphthongs, /a͡ɔ/ and /u͡e/, but wasn't averse to hiatus in general. Eventually this stabilizes into a more regular system. -i and later -u get swallowed up into the preceding syllable; in especially progressive varieties (mostly in the north around Uneth) final -e gets raised to -j as well (hence cacáé /tsatsaj/).

* o is generally lower the further north you get, and in Makóké /aɔ/ in practice is basically /ɑ:/. On this basis a length distinction actually starts to arise, with long vowels appearing roughly in open syllables or before /b d/.

* In the south (Kuelin, Western) aspirates have lost their aspiration and merged with voiceless mutes. In the north, weirdly, aspirates are still around, but /h/ is lost. Clearly this will not remain stable for long.

Now, enough of that, let's talk about Dálx:

Dálx has a somewhat unpleasant inventory of /p t b d 

* Obstruent clusters generally don't seem to have survived; it seems the first element is regularly lost: Maotic /ast/, Dálx /eθ/ "one"; Maotic /etkai/, Dálx /eho/ "island".



forget all this

I'm starting to get a clearer picture of *. * had a very weird inventory: p pʲ b bʲ t tʲ k kʲ ɢ ɢʲ ʔ~h~χ r~ʃ l lʲ r n nʲ w, vowels /a e i o u/. /s/ is from earlier /j/

I know it looks tempting to just put /q/ there and maybe we should, but I think it ends up as ɢ > ɴ or ɢ > ʁ/ʀ in all descendants. actually we should do a descendant where k q > k g


Taol sound change list:

* b > w

* ʃ > r rhotacism, but in what environments? kʲaʃpiɢ > caspeʁ, but taʃʔa > tara
* k > kʲ > ʃ / _{e,i}
* s > ʃ / _{e,i,u}
* i > e / _ɢ (but not _ɢʲ presumably)
* V > Vː / _(R)ʔ

* ʔT > ˀT (but maybe I should just write D)
* Tʔ > Tʰ
* ʔ > h / _V
* ʔ > 0 otherwise


* a becomes ɑ unless protected by a following palatal or palatalized consonant. in this respect we basically get a limited vowel harmony, b/c it spreads throughout the rest of the word too

* initial consonant clusters get ɑ epenthesized, including /l/
