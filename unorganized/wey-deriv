All of the above things were taken from Buck.

Here are some words that vary in LSJ:

ἠί = αἰεί (regular, but there should be a ϝ.)
ἀείτας = ἀετός. Not mentioned by Beekes, and not explainable.
ἀέροψ = μέροψ. Beekes says αϝεροψ with prothesis and ϝ~μ. Weirder is the presence of εἶροψ and Ἠέροπος.
αἱμακουρίαι = ἐναγίσματα. What is this formation?
Άλαλκομέν(ε)ιος = Μαιμακτηριών.
ἄλωμα = ἀνάλωμα. Buck says this is 'abstracted from ἀνάλωμα, hence the absence of ϝ".
κᾱ = ἄν.
ἀναιρέω "rescind, cancel" (other refs in D)
ἄνθειον 'flower, blossom'. Dub. reading in Ar.Ach.869
ἀνιάρωσις = ἀνῐέρωσις—see below
ἤνεσα = aor. of ἄνϝω. Must be Attic.
ἀξιοχρειέας = ἀξιόχρεως (acc. pl.) LSJ says ἀξιοχρηϝής (so es-stem). This fits— Hdt. has neut pl ἀξιόχρεα.
ἀπέκιξαν = 3pl aor of ἀπο-κίκω, a hapax in Ar.Ach.869
Ἀρτάμιδος = Ἀρτέμιδος (or -ιτος. Doric has Ἀρτάμιτος.)
ἀσαυτῦ = ἑαυτῷ, but in form a shortening of αὐσαυτῷ? Buck lists several shortenings of αὐτὸς αὐτός. At least four are Boeotian.
αὐτῖ = αὐτοῦ (Doric αὐτεῖ).
ἀφεδριατεύοντες 'title of a Boeotian magistracy'. IG7.3207, al.
ἅως = ἕως. From yāwos Beekes. So why the final long vowel?
βᾰνά = γυνή. Plural βανῆκες. In theory this is *gʷn̥ā, but γυνή is weird and defies this.
βείλομαι = βούλομαι. Not sure why.
Βελφός = Δελφός. Βελφίς also appears.
βέφῡρα = γέφυρα.
γλάχωνος = βλήχωνος (gen.)
βουῶν = βοῶν, and βούεσσι = βουσί. Should this be βοϝῶν?
γα = γε.
γίνιουμαι = γίγνομαι.
δακκύλιος = δακτύλιος.
διατᾱρέω = διατηρέω. But Doric διατηρέω.
Διώνουσος = Δῐόνῡσος. Also Epic.
διού = δύο, and δουῖν gen. for δυεῖν.
ἱών = ἐγώ, and ἱώνγα, ἱώνει, ἰώγα = ἔγωγε. Beekes is again unhelpful. Genitive ἐμοῦς, ἐμῶς, ἐμίο, ἐμίω, ἐμίως.
ἴστω = ἴττω (!)
ἐς = ἐκ, sometimes. See Buck 100.
ἐσγεννάσονθ᾿ = ἐκγεννήσοντ᾿. One of three mentions, so.
ἑκουρεύω = ἑκῠρεύω. Apparently hapax.
ἐληοχρίστιον = ἐλαιοχριστία (but -είστιον also attested.) ἐλαιος has digamma.
ἔππαμα = ἔμπᾱμα. Hapax, and is apparently from em-kʷāmn̥.
ἔππασις = ἔμπᾱσις. This one is actually cited by Buck.
ἔμπρακτος has a different meaning 'under bond'.
ἔμπραξις 'claim under a bond'. Hapax.
ἐμπύληος 'epithet of Poseidon at Thebes'. Cf. ἐμπύλιος.
ἐνᾰκηδέκᾰτος 'nineteenth'.
ἐνέπιν = ἐν(ν)έπειν.
ἐννόμιον, τὸ = "dues paid for pasturage".

ἐσλιήνω = ἐκλειαίνω.
ἔττε = ἔστε (ἐνσ-τε)
εὕδομος = ἕβδομος
ζεκελτίδες = γογγυλίδες or κολοκύνται. v.l. ζακ- as in Hsch
ἑμνιωβέλιον = ἡμιωβέλιον. See other forms.
ἤρᾱ = ἤρω (v.l. This is a 2sg mid, though—contracted for ᾰο.)
ἦρι = "early". Epic, but Boeotian acc. to AB1095.
θαράπηνα = θεράπαινα.
τεθμοφούλαξ = θεσμοφῠλαξ.
Θεόφειστος = -θεστος (?)
θιαωρία = θεωρία
θρᾱνυξ = θρῆνυς. θρῆνυξ is also attested once.

The Vowel System

After about 250 BC, the vowel system is long /i: e: ɛ: a: ɔ: (j)u: œ:/, short /i e a ɔ u/, dipthongs /au eu/ only. What is notable is that these arise from different sources than in Greek.

Because the alphabet has to be epichoric, and because I want this to be interesting, we're going to alter history a bit. Notably, Ͱ, which is probably roughly [ɪ ɪ:], is used for original *ey and for prevocalic *e. So here we're going to preserve that spelling—if not that pronunciation—for those words (but probably not for later words.)
Ι,Ͱ /i i:/		ΥΕ /y y:/	Υ /u u:/
Ε /e e:/	
ΑΕ /ɛ ɛ:/	ΟΕ /œ œ:/	Ο /ɔ ɔ:/
Α /a a:/

The rest of the alphabet goes like this:
Μ /m/	Ν /n/
Π /p/	Τ /t/	Κ /k/
Β /b/	Δ /d/	Γ /g/
Φ /pʰ/	Θ /tʰ/	Ψ /kʰ/
Χ /ks/	Σ /s/	Ζ /z/	Η /h/
Λ /l/	Ρ /r/	Ϝ /w/

Possible inferred sound changes
- Umlaut of /ai/ > /ɛ:/ and /ɔi/ > /ø:/ has already occurred. Theoretically /ui/ > /y:/ should have happened, but the only apparent occurences of /ui/ before a consonant are γυίζω, μυΐνδα? (a coinage), Δρυΐδης, θῠΐ¯της, κύϊξ (loanwords), ἄλλυι, ὅπυι, πήλυι, τυΐ (H), τυῖδε, υἷ, υἷς (cases), and a small set of suffixed υ-stems1. There is no record of Bœotian having the cases in -υι, and all other words have diaeresis.
- There are at least two (maybe three) morphological examples of gemination (at least spelled?) of σ after a short vowel. This could be extended to all cases of σ (except across morpheme boundaries?), so σέσελι 'hartwort' > σέσσελι. Extending this to all consonants is a harder argument.
     - If we shorten things before consonant clusters (which we may have to do anyway), we can add δδ, and perhaps all consonants.
- /g/ > /j/. This is actually a very early change apparently—it appears in Corinna—which would probably explain why we have ἰώ and not e.g. εἰω. On the other hand, it is very incomplete, suggesting that it was probably conditional.
     - Arcadian has ἐπιθιγγάνῃ > επιθιιάνε¯. Is this /g:/ or /Ng/, and, if the latter, can we derive from this /n'/ > /j/?

New sound changes
(Except where noted these postdate the classical period.)
- /mb/, /nd/, /ŋg/ become /m:/, /n:/, /ŋ:/.
- /b/ > /w/, universally, continuing a fine IE tradition. (This does include σβέννυμι > σϝεννυεμι.)
- Umlaut of /a/ > /ɛ/, /ɔ/ > /œ/, /u/ > /y/ before /i/ or /Cj/. /au/ > /œy/. Notably, however, there is no umlaut before intervocalic /j/.
- /s/ before R (incl. /j w/), where /s/ is actually [z] anyway, assimilates to the R in question, just as it had with /d/. φσᾱ́φισμα > φσᾱ́φιμμα, ϝίσϝος > ϝίϝϝος, ψρῡ́εσιος > ψρῡ́ειιος.
- Shortening of unstressed vowels in closed syllables. Note that stress is still consistent with tone.
- Lengthening of vowels before (final?) /n/.
- Shift of stress to the last long (heavy?) syllable, or, failing that, the antepenultimate syllable—however, stress only falls on the ultima if it also has high tone. However, in adjectives stress remains on the final syllable, due to influence from the feminine. In compounds stress accordingly tends to either the antepenultimate (usually the linking vowel) or the penultimate syllable. Given the later collapse of phonemic vowel length (?), this is regularized (?) to whatever syllable the second part of the compound had.
- /g/ > /h/.
- /hj/ > /ç/. I dunno how this is spelled; κη maybe?
- /aj/ > /ej/ (mb just allophonic [ɛj]) (wait, why?)
- ūV > umV (cf Hittite)
- The cluster /Clj/ simplifies to /Cj/. Probably the case with other liquids as well.
- There seems to be a difference between (C)ijV (from -ig-; also from -ī-) and (C)iV (from -i- or -e-). The latter one would seem to disappear in an unstressed syllable, notably, whereas the former doesn't.
- /st/ and /stʰ/ are assimilated to /ss/. Note that this is in contrast to /zd > dd/ (I guess /s/ just has a high (low?) sonority, which makes sense if it gets fortited to /sʰ/.) Note also that this is prior to /d > s > sʰ/ as the result is /ss/ regardless of aspiration.
- Similarly, initial pʰs and kʰs become /ss/.
- Lengthening of most consonants after short vowels. However, 
- Epenthesis of a vowel in VCŔ, i.e. κύκλος > κύκολος. (This makes the following change less awkward.)
- /s/ lowers the tone of the last mora. This results in the following tones:
	* -ο is 11
	* -ό- is 55
	* -ώ- is 15
	* -ῶ- is 53
	* -όσ- is 55 > 53
	* -ώσ- is 15 > 13
	* -ῶσ- is 53 > 51
	* -ὸ is 33
	* -ὼ is 13
	* -ῶ is 53
	* -ὸς is 33 > 31
	* -ὼς is 13 > 11
	* -ῶς is 53 > 51
	Since tones are completely absurd I'm just going to roll 2d4 for all of these:
	* -ό- is 55 > 13	ό
	* -ώ- is 15 > 13	ό
	* -ὸς is 31 > 34	ο̄1
	* -ῶ-/-όσ- is 53 > 24	ο͂2
	* -ὸ is 33 > 33		ὸ3
	* -ώσ-/-ὼ is 13 > 55	ο̏4
	* -ῶσ-/-ῶς is 51 > 42	ο̊5
	* -ο/-ὼς is 11 > 22	ο
- /s/ is then lost word-finally after a vowel.
- /d/ > /s/ > /sʰ/ (chain shift).
- Syncope of final short, unstressed vowels—except after fricatives?
- Also, syncope of other unstressed vowels in certain circumstances. This includes κεφάλα > πφάλα (assimilated.), πτερόν > ττρόν, 
- Assimilation of C+dental clusters to dentals: *κφάλᾱ > πφάλ as above; χθόν > τθόν; πτερόν > ττρόν. Also Ψαπφώ > Σσηαπφό
- Shortening of unstressed vowels, maybe also of stressed vowels.
- Loss of final unstressed /a/.
- Reduction of unstressed vowels starts to happen. This actually might get a little complicated, but:
	- Final /e i/ collapse into [ɪ] in most cases, but [e] before /n/. Also before /t/ for some reason?
	- Final /ɑ ɔ/ collapse into [ʌ], spelled <ο>.
	- Final /u/, /y/ tends to vary. In most dialects /u/ has centralized and derounded to [ɨ], and some merge this with /ɪ/ as well. Not that this probably matters, though—I can't think of any real examples of this except from -νυμι verbs. If that counts, though, then /y/ has undergone the same fate.
	- Final /ɛ/, /œ/ probably remains distinct? I'll have to maybe find a French dialectology study for this one.
