In 514 BC, Harmodius and Aristogeiton, commonly called the "Tyrannicides", attempted to assassinate the tyrants Hippias and Hipparchus. They only succeeded on the latter count, and Hippias stayed in power for another four years, until his increasingly cruel rule (and unnerving association with Persia) drove the Alcmaeonidae to take action to try to remove him. They bribed the Delphic Oracle to tell the Spartans to aid them in overthrowing Hippias' regime, and it worked. The Spartans marched to Athens, overthrew Hippias (allowing the Alcmaeonidae to take power and exile Hippias and the other remaining Pisistratids. Hippias later went on to join Xerxes and in fact guide him through his conquest of Greece.) An interesting consequence, however, was that, as the Spartans marched, they passed by Plataea, and the Plataeans asked them for aid in defending themselves against the aggressions of Thebes, which had been trying for years to conquer its neighboring cities and unify Boeotia. The Spartan king Cleomenes said no—such an alliance would be impossible to actualize due to the distance between Sparta and Plataea—but recommended that they seek help from Athens instead. They did this, and Athens accepted, and as a consequence Thebes and Athens became enemies. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, Athens rallied the various states of Greece to band together and repel the Persians—and Potidaea joined them, but Thebes refused, and instead fought on the Persian side. Following the war Thebes was punished for this action, by being removed from leadership of the Boeotian League. Athens, meanwhile, became the center of Greek literature, philosophy, and the arts. Following the conquest of Greece by Alexander the Great, its dialect (Attic) became the basis for Koinê Greek, which would later evolve into what we know today as Modern Greek.

In 514 BC, Harmodius and Aristogeiton, commonly called the "Tyrannicides", attempted to assassinate the tyrants Hippias and Hipparchus. They succeeded on both counts. Immediately the Alcmaeonidae took advantage of this opportunity to take back control of Athens. They exiled the remaining Pisistratids (Pisistratus son of Hippias in fact joined Xerxes and guided him through his later conquest of Greece.) Unrelatedly, in 507 the city of Plataea allied itself with Thebes to form the basis of what would later be called the Boeotian League, which was later strengthened by the addition of Thespis as a defensive measure against a Thessalian invasion. When the Persians invaded in 480, they were met at Thermopylae with a contingent of Boeotian and Peloponnesian troops, who, while not victorious, were able to hold off the main flank of the Persian army for long enough for the Corneia to end and the main flank of the Spartan army to set out in assistance. Soon afterwards the Allied navy, led by the Athenians, met and destroyed or routed a large portion of the Persian fleet at the Battle of Chalcis. Following this decisive victory the Persian army was met and defeated by a combined Boeotian and Spartan force at the Battle of Chaeronea. The following period marked Thebes as the center of Greek literature, philosophy, and the arts. Following the conquest of Greece by Alexander the Great, its dialect (Boeotian) became the basis for Koenâ Greek, which would later evolve into what we know today as Modern Greek.
