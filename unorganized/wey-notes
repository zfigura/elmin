I need more spaces for notes.


Problem: verbs in -g-. eg/ig becomes /j/, lg/rg just elides, and ng becomes /Nː/. But ag/og/ug could be problematic.

ago is the only verb in ag. It's being preserved as irregular.

tmāgo/tmăgon is an Epic collateral form of temno. Interesting.

tʰāgo 'sharpen'.

λήγω 'stay, abate' could be lēgō or lāgō. lāgo isn't attested but there are several nouns in lag- which MAY be related.

ᾰρήγω 'aid' is h₂reh₁g, because ἀρωγός, and because Attic should have arāgo.

fōgō 'roast'.

trōgō 'gnaw'. Aorist etrăgon.

feugo 'flee'.

frūgo 'roast, parch'. Aorist efrŭgēn.

trugo 'dry' is a hapax, but also shows up in Hsch.

ereugomai 'belch' and ereugomai 'roar'. The former has eruggano, but still aorist ērugon.

ăgămai 'wonder, admire'. Presumably leveled to ăgomai, but this doesn't help much.
