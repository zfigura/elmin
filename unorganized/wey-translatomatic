	o orans ta3 anäritʰomon werron eyen antʰropotropʰon
	tö3 antʰrops üt ekkʰon ep atʰö2 oranamöwon
	tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain.

		- anäritʰoms is analogized from nā-.
		- werron < werhon. I'm not sure about this but it seems good. (the other option is weron, or maybe wern.)
		- I must have it backwards because -οτρόφος is active and -τρεφής is passive
		- üt should maybe be replaced with a better word. then again maybe not
		- ἐπ᾿ ἀγαθῷ is a phrase I found and it is good. it's staying
		- sample text

Let's swim in the Sea of Racism.

	in tö2 tʰálatt tö2 to2 rasimms neömin

		- the double-article construction is usual and replaces the previously more common single-article construction.
		- word order in this sentence could use improving, but... idk, V3 is hard
		- maybe if we do a german and mandate subjects? so "we in-the-sea-of-racism swim.sbj"

In the beginning God ordered an Earth and large fries.

	o tʰeos kat ta orkʰa prokekeleuk i haj kkä makro lampto [kompir]

		- kkä is a strengthened form of kä; it is from te kai. I dunno if both of these will be used.
		- the indefinite article could be he5, í, hen3, or he5, ya3, hen3. if it's the first, then the other cases are ya5, yä2, ín. Which is why I kind of prefer the second, even though ya3 is unusual and might be regularized to ya4.
		- kompir is a loan from Macedonian.
		- tʰeos is a portuguese. It could be a spanish and be tʰeo1, though.

God, lend me your strength as I destroy my enemies.

	tʰeos, säniss ta4 wikkʰu mö3 ttʰo iyoŋ4 emo says ttʰairo

		- wikkʰu < ἰσχῡ́ς. This replaces wi < ϝῑ́ς (or wí < βία) which is poetic.
		- ttʰo < καθώς. This has a more imperfective sense compared to huts < οὕτως.
		- iyoŋ4 < ἰjώνγα. Why not iyoŋŋ? who knows. either inconsistent final shortening, or (more likely) iyon4 < ἰjών was analogized to *iyoŋŋ < ἰjώνγα.
		- says < δᾱ́ϊος. No digamma in Myc., so dayos > days. δαͱς I guess, unless δαϊς

	alternative:

	tʰeos, säniss ta4 wikkʰu emö3 sayottʰors

		- predication of sayottʰors. if you are a female, -ttʰor
		- in fact, this is a purpose clause, so we have every reason to do this
		- nb that emö3 is not enclitic mö3 because it has to stand as a noun proper so that sayottʰors can belong to it

My father's native language is English. I can understand and speak it.

	a emo1 tter4 pätor lôtt äŋŋlika4 sʰät. iyoŋ4 hwe sʰunik kä ik

		- patrios > pätrios > pätorjos > pätors/r/rn.
		- äŋlika is better probably
		- I want to do the thing where there's no copula, but that seems contrary to V3

I'm sorry, the bananas haven't been shipped in yet.

	mö sunnoma, ta banana aupo insʰola etʰon ppʰe1

		- there's no passive anymore so we just do topic fronting (+ dummy subject)

The tree threatened me, so I set it on fire.

	to3 senron emö3 ewewol, iyoŋ hai2 pepʰloy whe

		- hai2 < ἷ (doric εἷ)
		- this should theoretically be doable with a predicate clause, except that we can't make a compound with a pronoun

Please get your cow out of my way.

	hissʰe atʰo1, pöw ta4 au5 apek mo2 hoss

		- lolfinnish "be good"
		- okay, I am admittedly slightly concerned at the identicalness between 2sg and the article. I could do the clitic thing, but this ALSO looks sort of like the basis for a T>V? Except that I'm not sure Greek has any history of V existing so

You let a monkey in and then the monkeys ate all our bananas!

	tu in tthaks leluks, tö's tthaks hai esesokon hapon mos ämon

		- I'm still not especially happy about the aesthetic of the indefinite article
		- hai is a general conjunctive. no, this doesn't take a predicate either
		- 'eat' maybe needs to be regularized
		- should ämon be cliticized?

Why isn't the driver stopping the cart?

The smell of your brother is foul.

Don't wade into the cesspool!

I found the man who burned the house that your dad bought using the money he won from the lottery last month.

I guess you haven't bothered learning anything about me in the howeverlong we've been interacting here.

Dark matter pockets! Butts in your seats!

The guy who paved this tract of galaxy will have a few words from me.

Could someone come up with a good phrase to translate for translat-o-matic?

As the great old trees

The winter fly

the cat quickly ate

Wow... 640K and MS–DOS.

Furthermore I advise that Carthage is to be destroyed.

I'm going to fuck your face.

	iyoŋ ton prosʰopon waino

		- this is the conative. the future is identical but would show more bravado (should we differentiate it somehow?)

Give me your faith, something I can believe in, and you'll be my family, my brother, my friend. Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving. Teach me a lesson that I understand.

I am laughing at your not having a wife; as a result you are the one cooking your own food.

	iyoŋ ta2 awanäkökʰ to1 kathels ttʰim; tuhar eks apwäss epeps ton3 sʰaits to1

		- a-wanäk-ökʰ < ἀ-βαναικο-οχία
		- har < γε+αρα
		- idea: incorporate to1, because apparently all non-direct discourse is heavily agglutinating now

	alternative:

	iyoŋ ta2 awanäkökʰ to1 kathels ttʰim tuhar sʰaitopops

		- predicate clauses are the shit
		- I am laughing at your not having a wife [such that] you are food-cooking

 Ιογ ταν σηυγκοποφυλα̨κς πο̨τα̨τασς τθιμ κα̨ λυ̨ς.
 I'm debating between keeping the syncope and getting rid of it.

Our father, who art in heaven / hallowed be thy name / thy kingdom come / thy will be done / on earth as in heaven

	antero1 tter4 o en tö orans / ton3 onum hyare / ton3 wäsʰiliwyon erkʰ / tan4 auliss (kat)titto / ep tä2 hay huts en tö2 orans

		- hieros + -ao (not classical, but rather stative)
		- -wy- probably stays as is but could potentially > ẅ
		- ton3 is unambiguously 2sg, because otherwise it'd be to3, but if one wants to specify they can use =to as an enclitic, and this should maybe be done with auliss
		- the word order is still TFVR, i.e. basically SOVR, but since in imperatives the S is elided, this usually manifests as OV, but as here not always
		- anters is analogized to antero/a/on

Give us this day our epiousios bread / and forgive us our trespasses / as we forgive our trespassers

	tameron siso anteron3 katʰamers orts ämin / kä kʰale ämin anteran4 ampläk / huts ame anterö5 amplakter kʰalomin

		- how do I tell if huts or ttho, aaaaaa
		- what is and, is it kä (k'?) or is it maybe de kai > sk'
		- whatever it is, it acts like an adverb, like dé did
		- actually, why not predicate this into 'ame amplaktrokhali' (hang on, how do we form a compound with an -ao verb?)

and lead us not into temptation / but deliver us from evil

	kä <don't lead> ame en ton <temptation> / all <deliver> ame par to2 <evil>

		- we need an interesting way of forming negatives



Weyötiss has several notable grammatical features to be noted. At first glance, it appears to be SOV:

[g=ART.F-NOM.SG]Α[/g] [g=my-M-NOM.SG]εμο[/g] [g=father]ττερ[/g] [g=native-F]πα̨τορ[/g] [g=language]λοττ[/g] [g=ART.F-NOM.SG]α[/g] [g=English]Α̨γλικα[/g] [g=be.3SG]σηα̨τ.[/g] [g=1SG.NOM]Ιογ[/g] [g=3SG.ACC]ηϝε[/g] [g=understand-1SG]σηυνικ[/g] [g=and]κα̨[/g] [g=send]ικ.[/g]
[i]My father's native language is English. I can understand and speak it.[/i]

However, the object may be freely replaced with an adverb or adverbial phrase of higher valence:

[g=ART.M-NOM.SG]Ο[/g] [g=LORD]Θεος[/g] [g=from]κατ[/g] [g=ART.F-GEN.SG]τα[/g] [g=beginning]ορψα[/g] [g=order-PRET-3SG]προκεκελευκ[/g] [g=INDEF-F-ACC]ιν[/g] [g=earth]ηαj[/g] [g=and.also]κκα̨[/g] [g=ART.M-ACC.PL]το[/g] [g=large-M-ACC.PL]μακρο[/g] [g=fried-M-ACC.PL]λαμπτο[/g] [g=potato]κομπιρ.[/g]
[i]In the beginning, God ordered an Earth and large fries.[/i]

Note that the object does not precede the verb, but rather follows it, so the word order may more accurately be described as subject-focus-verb-remainder.

Having lost the passive, Weyötiss instead relies on topic-fronting to decrease valency:

[g=1SG.DAT]Μο̨[/g] [g=pardon]σηυγγομα[/g], [g=ART.F-ACC.PL]τα[/g] [g=banana]πανανα[/g] [g=not-yet]αυπο[/g] [g=in-shipping]ινσηολα[/g] [g=do.AOR-3PL]εθον[/g] [g=3PL.NOM]πφε.[/g]
[i]I'm sorry, the bananas haven't been shipped in yet.[/i]

Note that [b]ινσηολα[/b] is not treated like a noun, but rather is an inseparable element of the verb phrase [b]ινσηολα εθον[/b].

Omission of subject pronouns may be seen as antiquated, or (in the dialects of central Attica and Euboea) slang speech. Elision of [b]πφε[/b] in the sentence above is not only common in said dialects, but is seen in Boeotian and Peloponnesian colloquial speech as well.

Impersonals, by contrast, never take a subject:

[g=snow-PRES-3SG]Ναιφι.[/g]
[i]It's snowing.[/i]

All questions are marked with the interrogative particle [b]αρ[/b], which stands first in the sentence:

[g=INT]Αρ[/g] [g=who]τι[/g] [g=can-3SG]συνα̨[/g] [g=say-INF]φαμιν[/g] [g=where-REL]ηοπαι[/g] [g=ART.M-NOM.SG]ο[/g] [g=road]ηοσς[/g] [g=go-GNOM-3SG]εϝαν;[/g]
[i]Who can say where the road goes?[/i]

[g=INT]Αρ[/g] [g=2SG-NOM]τυ[/g] [g=in]επ[/g] [g=ART.F-ACC.SG]ταν[/g] [g=city~this]πο·λςκι[/g] [g=being-born]ηονα[/g] [g=do.AOR-2SG]εθικς;[/g]
[i]Were you born in this city?[/i]

Note however that questions using adverbs place the adverbs at the beginning of the sentence, before the subject:

[g=InT]Αρ[/g] [g=why]τι[/g] [g=ART.F-NOM.SG]α[/g] [g=driver-F]λα·τιρ[/g] [g=not]μα·[g] [g=stopping]παυ·σς[/g] [g=do.PRES-3SG]τθιτ[/g] [g=ART.M-ACC.SG]τον[/g] [g=car]αυτοκαινιτς;[/g]
[i]Why isn't the driver stopping the car?[/i]

The imperative acts like a normal sentence, but with the subject effectively dropped:
[g=good]Αθο[/g] [g=be.IMP.2SG]ηισσηε[/g], [g=thy.F-ACC.SG]τα[/g] [g=cow~2SG]αυτο[/g] [g=make-IMP.2SG]πο̨ϝ[/g] [g=out-of]απεκ[/g] [g=my-M-GEN.SG]μο[/g] [g=way]ηοσς.[/g]
[i]Please get your cow out of my way.[/i]

(Note that the article is effectively identical to the second person possessive, so the clitic -το, which marks the second person, is often added. In central Greece (and especially Attic) this usage has spread to the other personal clitics -μο and -ϝηο.)

However, in the Arcadian and Boeotian dialects, the imperative comes first, such that the above sentences would be translated as [b]Αθο ηισσηε, πο̨ϝ τα αυτο απεκ μο ηοσς[/b].

It is also possible to use subjects with the imperative, although this usage is somewhat antiquated:

[g=thy.N-NOM.SG]Τον[/g] [g=kingdom]ϝα̨σηιλιϝιον[/g] [g=come-IMP.3SG]ερχ.[/g]
[i]Thy kingdom come.[/i]

There are two ways to attach adjectives to nouns in Weyötiss. The former is simply placing the adjective between the noun and article, as above: [b]ο σηοφο νερ[/b] [i]the wise man[/i]. The second is placing the adjective after the noun, and repeating the article, and has the effect of shifting focus slightly onto the noun: [b]ο νερ ο σηοφο[/b] [i]the man who is wise[/i]. One must be careful not to omit the second article in this construction, as doing so causes the sentence to have an entirely different meaning (see "Predicate clauses" below.)

Genitives work in a similar manner: [b]α το πα̨ς ματερ[/b] [i]the child's mother[/i], [b]α ματερ α το πα̨ς[/b] [i]the mother of the child[/i]. The latter construction is more common in colloquial Weyötiss, and the second (genitive-marking) article is often dropped, e.g. [b]α ματερ α πα̨ς[/b].

In both cases, an important thing to note is that the second construction is effectively treated as two noun phrases for the purpose of word order, so while [b]Ιογ τον σηοφον νερ ϝεϝορακ.[/b] is a correct translation of "I saw the wise man", [b]**Ιογ τον νερ τον σηοφον ϝεϝορακ.[/b] is incorrect and must be replaced with [b]Ιογ τον νερ ϝεϝορακ τον σηοφον.[/b] Similarly, [b]Ιογ ταν ματερ ϝεϝορακ ταν το πα̨ς.[/b]

PREDICATE CLAUSES

One of the most unique and pervasive features of Weyötiss is the <predicate clause>, or predicate clause. A predicate clause consists of an adjective placed after a noun, without an interposing article, and implies intent, purpose, or effect, and is thus often translated with the English infinitive of purpose. While it can be used with a simple adjective, it is most often used with an exocentric compound, a highly productive class of words retained from Ancient Greek. Take the following sentence:

[g=1SG.NOM]Ιογ[/g] [g=thy-F-GEN.SG]τα[/g] [g=not-wife-having~2SG]αϝανα̨κο̨χτο[/g] [g=at-laughing]κατηελς[/g] [g=do-PRES-1SG]τθιμ[/g] [g=2SG.NOM]τυ[/g] [g=food-cooking-M]σηαιτοποπς.[/g]
[i]I am laughing at your not having a wife, as a result you are the one cooking your own food.[/i]

The most direct translation of this sentence would be [i]I am laughing at your not-wife-having[/i] ([b]α-ϝανα̨κ-ο̨χ[/b]) [i], [such that] you [are] food-cooking.[/i] This is a slightly less than prototypical construction—the predicate clause is not an effect of the laughing, but rather of an embedded verbal noun.

The adjective in a predicate clause can also refer to a noun used elsewhere in the sentence:

[g=ART.M-NOM.PL]Το̨[/g] [g=man]ανθροπς[/g] [g=nothing]αυ̨τ[/g] [g=have.GNOM-3PL]εκψον[/g] [g=ART.N-ACC.SG]το[/g] [g=on]επ[/g] [g=good-M-DAT.SG]αθο̨[/g] [g=heaven-exchanging-N]οραναμο̨ϝον.[/g]
[i]Man has nothing good with which to recompense Heaven.[/i] (lit. "Men have nothing on good [to be] Heaven-recompensing.")

In the above sentence the predicate clause agrees with [b]αυ·τ[/b] "nothing".
