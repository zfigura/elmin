heaven brings forth innumerable things to nurture man
man has nothing good with which to recompense heaven
kill. kill. kill. kill. kill. kill. kill.

	o orans ta3 anäritʰomon werron eyen antʰropotropʰon
	tö3 antʰrops üt ekkʰon ep atʰö2 oranamöwon
	tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain. tʰain.

		- anäritʰoms is analogized from nā-.
		- werron < werhon. I'm not sure about this but it seems good. (the other option is weron, or maybe wern.)
		- I must have it backwards because -οτρόφος is active and -τρεφής is passive
		- üt should maybe be replaced with a better word. then again maybe not
		- ἐπ᾿ ἀγαθῷ is a phrase I found and it is good. it's staying
		- sample text

Let's swim in the Sea of Racism.

	in tö2 tʰálatt tö2 to2 rasimms neömin

		- the double-article construction is usual and replaces the previously more common single-article construction.
		- word order in this sentence could use improving, but... idk, V3 is hard
		- maybe if we do a german and mandate subjects? so "we in-the-sea-of-racism swim.sbj"

In the beginning God ordered an Earth and large fries.

	o tʰeos kat ta orkʰa prokekeleuk i haj kkä makro lampto [kompir]

		- kkä is a strengthened form of kä; it is from te kai. I dunno if both of these will be used.
		- the indefinite article could be he5, í, hen3, or he5, ya3, hen3. if it's the first, then the other cases are ya5, yä2, ín. Which is why I kind of prefer the second, even though ya3 is unusual and might be regularized to ya4.
		- kompir is a loan from Macedonian.
		- tʰeos is a portuguese. It could be a spanish and be tʰeo1, though.

God, lend me your strength as I destroy my enemies.

	tʰeos, säniss ta4 wikkʰu mö3 ttʰo iyoŋ4 emo says ttʰairo

		- wikkʰu < ἰσχῡ́ς. This replaces wi < ϝῑ́ς (or wí < βία) which is poetic.
		- ttʰo < καθώς. This has a more imperfective sense compared to huts < οὕτως.
		- iyoŋ4 < ἰjώνγα. Why not iyoŋŋ? who knows. either inconsistent final shortening, or (more likely) iyon4 < ἰjών was analogized to *iyoŋŋ < ἰjώνγα.
		- says < δᾱ́ϊος. No digamma in Myc., so dayos > days. δαͱς I guess, unless δαϊς

	alternative:

	tʰeos, säniss ta4 wikkʰu emö3 sayottʰors

		- predication of sayottʰors. if you are a female, -ttʰor
		- in fact, this is a purpose clause, so we have every reason to do this
		- nb that emö3 is not enclitic mö3 because it has to stand as a noun proper so that sayottʰors can belong to it

My father's native language is English. I can understand and speak it.

	a emo1 tter4 pätor lôtt äŋŋlika4 sʰät. iyoŋ4 hwe sʰunik kä ik

		- patrios > pätrios > pätorjos > pätors/r/rn.
		- äŋlika is better probably
		- I want to do the thing where there's no copula, but that seems contrary to V3

I'm sorry, the bananas haven't been shipped in yet.

	mö sunnoma, ta banana aupo insʰola etʰon ppʰe1

		- there's no passive anymore so we just do topic fronting (+ dummy subject)

The tree threatened me, so I set it on fire.

	to3 senron emö3 ewewol, iyoŋ hai2 pepʰloy whe

		- hai2 < ἷ (doric εἷ)
		- this should theoretically be doable with a predicate clause, except that we can't make a compound with a pronoun

Please get your cow out of my way.

You let a monkey in and then the monkeys ate all our bananas!

Why isn't the driver stopping the cart?

The smell of your brother is foul.

Don't wade into the cesspool!

I found the man who burned the house that your dad bought using the money he won from the lottery last month.

I guess you haven't bothered learning anything about me in the howeverlong we've been interacting here.

Dark matter pockets! Butts in your seats!

The guy who paved this tract of galaxy will have a few words from me.

Could someone come up with a good phrase to translate for translat-o-matic?

how many gallons
of Edo's rain did you drink?
cuckoo

congratulations
issa... you have survived to feed
this year's mosquitoes

As the great old trees
are marked for felling, the birds
build their new spring nests

The winter fly
I caught and finally freed
the cat quickly ate

Wow... 640K and MS–DOS.

Furthermore I advise that Carthage is to be destroyed.

I'm going to fuck your face.

	iyoŋ ton prosʰopon waino

		- this is the conative. the future is identical but would show more bravado (should we differentiate it somehow?)

Give me your faith, something I can believe in, and you'll be my family, my brother, my friend. Tell me a truth that I find not deceiving. Teach me a lesson that I understand.

I am laughing at your not having a wife; as a result you are the one cooking your own food.

	iyoŋ ta2 awanäkökʰ to1 kathels ttʰim; tuhar eks apwäss epeps ton3 sʰaits to1

		- a-wanäk-ökʰ < ἀ-βαναικο-οχία
		- har < γε+αρα
		- idea: incorporate to1, because apparently all non-direct discourse is heavily agglutinating now

	alternative:

	iyoŋ ta2 awanäkökʰ to1 kathels ttʰim tuhar sʰaitopops

		- predicate clauses are the shit
		- I am laughing at your not having a wife [such that] you are food-cooking

 I'm debating between keeping the syncope and getting rid of it.
