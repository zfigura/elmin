Suppose we take Ancient Greek's inclination towards exocentric compounds and expand that such that any arguments to verbs get incorporated into compounds. Then we can mess with enclitics as well.

Note that we get three forms of any given compound: adjective, noun, verb:

ἱπποτρόφος - horse-breeding > hippotrop-
ἰπποτροφία - horse breeding > hippotröp
ἰπποτροφέω - I breed horses > hippotröp-

If we wanted to supply a subject, here's how I would do it:

σύ ἱπποτρόφος - thou horse-breeding
ἁ ἱπποτροφία σου - thy horse-breeding
(σύ) ἱπποτροφέεις - thou breedst horses

I like the second form with the genitive, maybe we could arbitrarily spread it?

Interesting thing is, this works with nouns too:

ὀρθόθριξ (or -τριχος) - straight-haired > worthothriks
ὀρθοτριχία - (the state of having) straight hair > worthotrikh
ὀρθοτριχέω - I am straight-haired > worthotrikho

Of these apparently -ia is hardest to attest (it was for hair anyway) which isn't especially surprising but unfortunate. On the other hand I can't find any compounds in -παιδέω.
