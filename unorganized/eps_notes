Because I may forget how things work.


Sound changes from Proto-* to Taol (as is, but this may change:)

^CR > CɑR

I can't actually tell what I am doing wrt vowel distribution

a vs ɑ:
tlaytʔ > tɑlaitʰ
ayet > âc-ti
cant > cɑ̄n-ti
kʔaʔ > kʰā-ši
caɢʲ > cāʁ
nanʲ > nan-ō
ʔnad > nɑ̄t
talʲ > tal-ō
caspiq > cāsper
acʲt > act-ō
atʲlusʶ > atlos
aloʔnei > alōnē (error for alonʔei I suspect)
tarʔa > tārā
pʔatʲu > pʰato

as far as I can tell *a results from /a/ followed by an i/ʲ. so presumably kʰā-ši is an error.

that said I'm also not sure how much I like the palatalization contrast. there was something aesthetic about it when I started but... hmm.

maybe I just need one palatal series? at any rate doing this is the most boring way to invent an a/ɑ contrast.

anyway, sound changes

VRC > V:RC. I suppose /s/ must count in cásper, or alternatively something else that became /s/.

ti > ši except when blocked by /n/.
s > š before high vowels. (lek-si is probably an error.)


Dálx does... what does Dálx do?

* ɑ > a
* a umlauted to e
* š > s
* h lost
* c > h
* t > th before front vowels, > s before back vowels?
  * we also have c > ç, but my notes say "probably secondary" whatever that means
* final vowels shortened or lost incl. diphth
* ʁ lost everywhere
* tR > taR (but not p!)
* VCC > V^C generally
