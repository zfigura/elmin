This language is called "wen", after the word for "kill"—see the 7KS below.

The defining change of this language is that, unlike any other IE language including the Anatolian branch, sequences of VH always gave V:—including, notably, eh₂ > ē, and eh₃ > ē. Additionally, h₂e and h₃e > e. In effect this was H > h₁.

To distinguish this from just /a/ > /e/, I do however include the usual sources of /a/, that is: R̥ > aR (and R̥̄ > āR, cf. ǵʰm̥mō > ǵʰm̥̄ō > ǵʰāmō), H̥ > a, R̥H > Rā. (yes, strictly speaking the lack of o/ō as a reflex of *h₃ would tip one off, but this phoneme is relatively rare.)

Initially I had decided that this language could conceivably be Anatolian (as Anatolian kept *h₂/h₃ and possibly also *h₁, and these phonemes could be merged after that.) There were a few things I wanted to do, though, that are counter to any IE language. One of these is a sort of modified version of Szemerényi's law, whereby VRH anywhere becomes V:R. Thus *terh₂ > tēr (*torh₂ > tōr, *trh₂ > trā).

/s/ probably ends up getting treated like a laryngeal in many cases, except with different effects. After V(R) it's deleted with no effect, but intervocalically and word-initially it stays. Preconsonantally (and possibly postconsonantally) I might like to have it modify the consonant and then disappear. So all in all, it stays in the environments that are the exact inverse of Greek's.

The etymology of the Greek λᾶας is *lāsh₂s.
lāsh₂s  > λᾶας
lāsh₂os > λᾶος
lāsh₂i  > λᾶι
lāsh₂n  > λᾶαν

What do IE languages do with intervocalic *s?

Albanian  > r?
Anatolian > š
Armenian  > z > Ø?
Baltic    > s?
Slavic    > x
Celtic    > s > Ø?
Germanic  > z > r (or sometimes s)
Greek     > h > Ø
Latin     > r
Sanskrit  > s
Tocharian > s?

Some of them keep it, but most don't. Let's be the one that keeps it.

I have no qualms about deleting it before or after a consonant—Hittite did this with laryngeals.

anyway, uh

- bʰ dʰ ǵʰ gʰ gʷʰ > β z ɣʲ ɣ w / #_V, V_V
- ɣʲ > dʒ / _{e,i}
- ɣ > g
- Dʰ restored from CH (maybe other sources?)
- T D Dʰ > T T D
- palatalization of ḱ ǵ into č ǰ (centum-style... but I don't really feel like having palatals)
- č ǰ > ts dz (dʒ is also ǰ)
- r > d in some conditions

p t ts   (k) kʷ
  t ts   (k) kʷ
β z dz/k (k) w


but the actual inventory is like

p t ts k kʷ
b d dz g gʷ
  s    x
β z   j  w

the usual example word is *bʰer- > βer- but I don't want to type that so we're going to use *weǵʰ- > wek- instead

*what is this even from

also some of the endings should be reworked since I'm just working off the enwikt table rn

I don't *really* like the subjunctive aesthetic... we should replace it so the last vowel gets lengthened instead of the penult

I also don't *really* like ôyC...

also kʷ is literally /kw/ so kʷe > kô, we fox now


Actually, this language needs some diphthong resolution anyway, I think.

ey ay oy > ê â ô
ew aw ow > e ô ô
V:y > V:yi
V:w > V:we (but êw > êwi)

eR oR aR
ê  ô  i
e  ô  u

This actually looks pretty nice.

I think I'm going to shift things around and combine the best parts of the primary and secondary endings:

1/2ary	impv	sbjv	optv
wekom	wekô	wekô	wekôyim
wekesi	wek	wekesî	wekôy
weketi	weketu	weketî	wekôyit
wekô	wekô	wekô	wekôyô
weketom	weketom	weketom	wekôyitom
weketâm	weketâm	weketâm	wekôyitâm
wekomô	wekomê* wekomô	wekôyime
wekete	wekete  weketê	wekôyite
wekon	wekontu wekontî	wekôyin

So now I need to ask—how do I create a new past tense? (Do I even want to? Probably—having no way to give past tense is odd. Although we could just relegate that all to the perfect or something.)

Here's the perfect, by the way:

wewoke
wewohte
wewoke
wewikô
wewihtom
wewihtâm
wewikmô
wewike
wewikêd

-i- is the epenthesized vowel.

I don't like -km- but I'm not sure what to do with it. Maybe another -i-? wewikimô? Maybe delete the m entirely (or m > w > Ø); I kind of like that one better.

Also: I could potentially replace the imperative weketu, wekontu with weketo, wekonto.

Let's try out the middle:

1ary	2ary	impv	sbjv	optv
wekôd	wekô	
wekeded	wekede	wekeso
wekêd	wekê	weketo
wekôd	wekôd
wekêtô	weketê
wekêtê	weketê
wekomôd	wekomed
wekedô	wekedô	wekedô
wekerod	wekero	wekero

Not orod because... dissimilation or something, idk.

Some of these look nice and some are really just kinda ugly. I don't know why the middle is this hard honestly. I need to Learn Sanskrit first.

Athematics:

1ary	2ary	impv	sbjv	optv
lêkwi	lêkam
lêhî	lêkâ
lêhti	lêht
likô	likô
lihtê	lihtom
lihtê	lihtam
likô
lihte
likenti

m̥ n̥ > am an

tweaking diphthong resolution: V:RC > VRC, then oy > ay, then VyC > VyiC, VwC > VwiC? also then we get elision of the first vowel probably. redone optative:

wekom	wekayim (> wekyim > wekîm?)
wekesi	wekayi
weketi	wekayit
wekô	wekayô
weketom	wekayitom
weketâm	wekayitâm
wekomô	wekayime
wekete	wekayite
wekon	wekayin

êm	syêm (siyêm?)
esi	syê
êt	syêt
sô	sîwe
tom	sîtom
tâm	sîtâm
mô	sîme
te	sîte
sen	sîn

ey > ê is earlier and doesn't get affected by this; word-finally or before a vowel remains ey

ts/č are allophones; č occurs after <r l>. presumably they'd be orthographically distinct, but whose alphabet are we borrowing? phoenician probably, at a relatively early point

sr > R

tyewi tsêneti nâriton rêyin drebon gâmonam
gâmoney ne sêm êti enti-geldon tyêm
wen wen wen wen wen wen wen

we need to also think about: verbal suffixes

-eskoh > êkom

ḱlewos n̥dʰgʷʰitom

člewô andûtom

*h₃estH- > esdʰ- > êd-
*pro > prô

*Hoywos > awô
*duoh₃ > tô
*treyes > treyê
*kʷetwores > kôtôrê
*penkʷe > penkô
*sweḱs > sôts
*septm̥ > septam
*h₃eḱteh₃ > estê
*h₁newn̥ > newam
*deḱm̥ > tetsam

contraction rules:

we, wo > ô
wi, wu > û
ye > ye

Past prefix e- gets... generalized to other cases? Replaces the primary-secondary distinction, but I'm not sure how to draw the causal arrows.

I'm also not sure how to reflect the perfective/imperfective distinction.

nominal paradigm (following Sihler):

actually, we're going to do 'fuck hittite'

feminine stems:

h₂wl̥h₁neh₂ "wool"

NOM	wâlnê	walnê
VOC	wâlnê	walnê
ACC	wâlnêm	walnêm
INS	wâlnê	walnêβi
DAT	wâlnê	walnêmô
ABL	wâlnê	walnêmô
GEN	wâlnê	?
LOC	wâlnê	walnêsu

almost all of the singular cases just fold together. I like the basic idea but this is a problem

*nebʰos "cloud"

NOM	neβô	neβô
VOC	neβô	neβô
ACC	neβô	neβô
INS	neβesê	neβêbi
DAT	neβesê	neβêmô
ABL	neβesô	neβêmô
GEN	neβesô	?
LOC	neβesî	neβêsu

this is much better.kill genitive at least (replace with ablative?), others?

*h₂ster- "star"

NOM	têr	terê
VOC	ter	terê
ACC	teram	terâm
INS	tarê	tarbi
DAT	tarê	tarmô
ABL	tarê	tarmô
