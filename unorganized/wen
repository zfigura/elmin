The defining change of this language is that, unlike any other IE language including the Anatolian branch, sequences of VH always gave V:—including, notably, eh₂ > ē, and eh₃ > ē. Additionally, h₂e and h₃e > e. In effect this was H > h₁.

To distinguish this from just /a/ > /e/, I do however include the usual sources of /a/, that is: R̥ > aR (and R̥̄ > āR, cf. ǵʰm̥mō > ǵʰm̥̄ō > ǵʰāmō), H̥ > a. (yes, strictly speaking the lack of o/ō as a reflex of *h₃ would tip one off, but this phoneme is relatively rare.)

Initially I had decided that this language could conceivably be Anatolian (as Anatolian kept *h₂/h₃ and possibly also *h₁, and these phonemes could be merged after that.) There were a few things I wanted to do, though, that are counter to any IE language. One of these is a sort of modified version of Szemerényi's law, whereby VRH anywhere becomes V:R. Thus *terh₂ > tēr (*torh₂ > tōr, *trh₂ > trā).

/s/ probably ends up getting treated like a laryngeal in many cases, except with different effects. After V(R) it's deleted with no effect, but intervocalically and word-initially it stays. Preconsonantally (and possibly postconsonantally) I might like to have it modify the consonant and then disappear. So all in all, it stays in the environments that are the exact inverse of Greek's.
