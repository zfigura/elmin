New design of Kyndae. Borrows from the old, but is also new.

* Kyndae has an Englishoid set of coronals, *and* retroflexes. It's kind of
  insane. A lot of these are going to have clear derivation though (only appear
  in some environments, etc.)

* pʲ tʲ kʲ > ps ts č? And č may turn into our retroflex series

* tʔ ʔt merge to something like ɗ, then t ɗ > θ d. (Applies to all POAs)

* Consonant clusters assimilate to the second consonant, always; initials just
  lose the first consonant

* I think we need to shorten geminates based on stress?

* non-geminate n > h
