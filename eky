New design of Kyndae. Borrows from the old, but is also new.

* Kyndae has an Englishoid set of coronals, *and* retroflexes. It's kind of
  insane. A lot of these are going to have clear derivation though (only appear
  in some environments, etc.)

* tʔ ʔt merge to something like ɗ.

* Vowels are reduced to ə before a nasal.

* ə is epenthesized after final clusters.

* Other consonant clusters assimilate to the second consonant, except /n/ (which
  still has poa allophony). Initials just lose the first consonant

* pʲ tʲ kʲ > ps ts č. č is a proper stop, and eventually shifts back to a
  retroflex. This affects ɠʲ but not ɓʲ ɗʲ; those just lose palatalization
  instead.

* t ɗ > θ d. (Applies to all POAs). This only applies to unpalatalized glottal
  stop. Frication is blocked by nasalization.

* Second palatalization of velars and palatals to tʃ/dʒ, in CjV. Then that /j/
  is lost.

* Other intervocalic /j/ strengthens to dʒ.

* Clusters lose their first member, again except for nasals.

* Unstressed rimes are weakened. Intervocalic non-geminates are voiced, then
  geminates are shortened. Primary stress falls some number of syllables from
  the end (either penult or antepenult?) and secondary stress on alternating
  syllables from there.

* /w/ merges with /v/.

* Utterance-initial and utterance-final obstruents are devoiced.

* Lose final unstressed vowels.

* non-geminate n > h exc. before an obstruent. This applies anywhere.

* G resolves to ŋ

* /x/... what happens to /x/? Maybe it dies at an earlier point, but I almost
  want to keep it. ɣ should die though and result in hiatus.

* Final nasal clusters (nC) lose the final consonant. Nasals elsewhere do *not*.


kʲatkiʔʲ > čakkij > csáxi
kuʔnuwt > xýnnuft??
