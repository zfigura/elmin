New design of Kyndae. Borrows from the old, but is also new.

* Do something with G (what?) unless deleting it

* Kyndae has an Englishoid set of coronals, *and* retroflexes. It's kind of
  insane. A lot of these are going to have clear derivation though (only appear
  in some environments, etc.)

* tʔ ʔt merge to something like ɗ.

* Vowels are reduced to ə before a nasal.

* ə is epenthesized after final clusters.

* Other consonant clusters assimilate to the second consonant, except /n/ (which
  still has poa allophony). Initials just lose the first consonant

* pʲ tʲ kʲ > ps ts c (incl voiced). c is a proper stop, and eventually shifts to
  a retroflex. ps ts will eventually lose the stop and become just /s/.

* i > u / _p [only closed syllables?]

* t ɗ > θ d. (Applies to all POAs). This only applies to unpalatalized glottal
  stop. Frication is blocked by nasalization and in ST.

* Second (mostly synchronically reconstructable) palatalization s > š before
  /i/.

* Intervocalic /j/ strengthens to dʒ.

* Clusters lose their first member, again except for nasals.

* Unstressed rimes are weakened. Intervocalic non-geminates are voiced, then
  geminates are shortened. Primary stress falls some number of syllables from
  the end (either penult or antepenult?) and secondary stress on alternating
  syllables from there.

* /w/ merges with /v/.

* Utterance-initial (and utterance-final?) obstruents are devoiced.

* Lose final unstressed vowels.

* a > y before a closed fricative (incl. geminates)

* y > i before /s ʃ/

* non-geminate n > h exc. before an obstruent. This applies anywhere.

* in > an, un > yn

* shorten geminated fricatives? (dialectal?)

* /x/... what happens to /x/? Maybe it dies at an earlier point, but I almost
  want to keep it. ɣ should die though and result in hiatus.

* Final nasal clusters (nC) lose the final consonant. Nasals elsewhere do *not*.


kʲatkiʔʲ > cakkij > cakkəj > csákky (or csáxy? csášy?)
kuʔnuwt > xýnnuft

I think /a/ moves back and /y/ moves down-center over the course of Kyndae's
life. At an extreme point 


tuʔʲ-uʔ > þyžu "five" not þužu. Why? Dissimilation, I think. In that case is the
alteration retained in the stem? Perhaps for a few fossilized words it is, but
not elsewhere; other words regularize to one or the other.
